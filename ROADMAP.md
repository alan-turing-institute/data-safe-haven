# Roadmap

This document sets out the plan for the evolution of the Data Safe Haven codebase.
It covers both short term goals, which are organised in sprint milestones, and long term goals, which are expected without a particular time frame.
It also collects desirable features which are unplanned or which we have decided not to pursue yet.
