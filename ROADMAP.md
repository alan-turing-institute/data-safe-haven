# Roadmap

This document sets out the plan for the evolution of the Data Safe Haven codebase.
It covers both short term goals, which are organised in sprint milestones, and long term goals, which are expected without a particular time frame.
It also collects desirable features which are unplanned or which we have decided not to pursue yet.

## Governance

This document is written by the code's [development lead](https://github.com/JimMadge) with input from the development team.

When deciding on what features to include in the roadmap, and where to include them we consider, in no particular order,

- The maintainability of the code (looking after the developers)
- Supporting users at The Alan Turing Institute (a significant user who we have a close relationship with)
- Supporting all users we are in contact with
- Integrating with, and building compatibility for, common infrastructure in the UK TRE landscape

These factors are balanced when making decisions.
There is no formal process for assigning scores for the above factors, or the weight each should be given.
In general, we currently consider the needs of our colleagues at The Alan Turing institute as our single most important user.
However, we also have opinions and expertise in trusted research and aim to inform the Turing rather than be directed by them.
Furthermore, we wouldn't necessarily let the priorities or opinions of the Turing overrule those of other users.

For example,

- User A wants new feature X next, the Turing wants new feature Y next.
    - We would be inclined to prioritise feature Y over X.
- The majority of the community feels the TRE should behave in manner X, a minority of the community, including the Turing, feels the TRE should behave in manner Y.
    - We would be inclined to design the TRE to behave in manner X.

At a time when the project has a large and active user base, we would like to better formalise how users feedback and ideas influence the roadmap.
