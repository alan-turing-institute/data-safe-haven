# Don't make parameters mandatory as if there is any issue binding them, the script will prompt for them
# and remote execution will stall waiting for the non-present user to enter the missing parameter on the
# command line. This take up to 90 minutes to timeout, though you can try running resetState.cmd in
# C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows\1.1.0 on the remote VM to cancel a stalled
# job, but this does not seem to have an immediate effect
