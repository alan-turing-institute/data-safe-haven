# Intro
Prior to publishing reports/papers, code or data that is currently being stored within the Turing Safe Haven a reclassification process must be followed. This is to ensure that any material that is to be made public is free of any confidential material. If commercially sensitive information is published this could lead to reputational or financial repercussions. If personal or personal sensitive information is leaked then it could lead to legal repercussions (See the [ICO Website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/) for more information on this). 

The process is divided into two stages: declassification and then egress.

# Reclassification
Much like the process for initial classification of the project, the same three representatives (The investigator, dataset provider representative and the referee)  who classified the project at the beginning will need to again individually conduct the same assessment on the results. Declassification should take place within the Turing Safe Haven environment.  `do we want to mention where? Data Set provider might need to be able to do this from their organisation if unable to come to Turing or other "safe access point" `

Following the flowchart for tier selection, the representatives should make note of any item that they would consider makes the results a tier 2 or above classification. If all three representatives mutually return a tier 0 or 1 classification then the results can be safely removed from the secure research environment. However, if there are differences, or if the agreed classification is 2 or above, a face to face discussion should be arranged. An email discussion is strongly not recommended here as the conversation may need to discuss sensitive information.

## Items for discussion in the case of mismatched classification
This discussion should focus on what features of the results prompted the different classification. Agreement must be made. In the case of two competing arguments, the  for the higher classification should take precedence.

## Items for discussion when the classification is tier 2 or higher

Each item that was deemed to be sensitive at tier 2 or higher will need to be reviewed with the purpose of how it will be represented in its public form. The representatives will need to decided and collectively agree to:
* further pseudonymise the item
* aggregate, restructure or reword the item so as it does not reveal the sensitive detail
* remove the item all together

Care should be made to ensure that whichever option is chosen for each item, the results do not lose the overall meaning.

## Egress of secure materials back to a data provider

It may be the case that Tier 2 or above items need to be removed from the secure compute environment and returned to a data provider. Code and derived data will be securely transferred to the Data Set Provider. This may also be necessary in the case of review of sensitive materials for reclassification where the provider could not otherwise acceess the environment. 

With the results reclassified, they will be transferred to the Data Set Provider and any other party involved in the project. Please refer to the three methods of transferring data back to a provider [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/blob/master/processes/secure-egress.md)

# Management of reclassified materials pending publication

Within Turing, reclassified results at Tier 1 or below may be archived using normal business information processes in preparation for publication.
