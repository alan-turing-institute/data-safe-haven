# xStorage

The **xStorage** module is a part of the Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) Resource Kit, which is a collection of DSC Resources.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

This module contains the **xMountImage, xDisk, and xWaitForDisk** resources.  The xMountImage resource can be used to mount or unmount an ISO/VHD disk image to the local file system, with simple declarative language.  The xDisk and xWaitforDisk resources enable you to wait for a disk to become available and then initialize, format, and bring it online using PowerShell DSC.

**NOTE:** The xDisk resource follows a process to detect the existance of a RAW disk, initialize the disk, create a volume, assign a drive letter of specific size (if provided) or maximum size, then format the new volume using NTFS and assign a volume label if one is provided.
Before beginning that operation, the disk is marked 'Online' and if it is set to 'Read-Only', that property is removed.
While this is intended to be non-destructive, as with all experimental resources the scripts contained should be thoroughly evaluated and well understood before implementing in a production environment or where disk modifications could result in lost data.

**All of the resources in the DSC Resource Kit are provided AS IS, and are not supported through any Microsoft standard support program or service. The "x" in xStorage stands for experimental**, which means that these resources will be **fix forward** and monitored by the module owner(s).

Please leave comments, feature requests, and bug reports in the Q & A tab for this module.

If you would like to modify this module, feel free. When modifying, please update the module name, resource friendly name, and MOF class name (instructions below). As specified in the license, you may copy or modify this resource as long as they are used on the Windows Platform.

## Examples

### Example - xWaitForDisk, xDisk

This configuration will wait for disk 2 to become available, and then make the disk available as two new formatted volumes, 'G' and 'J', with 'J' using all available space after 'G' has been created.
It also creates a new ReFS formated volume on Disk 3 attached as drive letter 'S'.

```powershell

{

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xStorage

    Node localhost
    {
        xWaitforDisk Disk2
        {
             DiskNumber = 2
             RetryIntervalSec = 60
             RetryCount = 60
        }

        xDisk GVolume
        {
             DiskNumber = 2
             DriveLetter = 'G'
             Size = 10GB
        }

        xDisk JVolume
        {
             DiskNumber = 2

        DriveLetter = 'V'
    }

    xWaitForVolume WaitForVHD
    {
        DriveLetter      = 'V'
