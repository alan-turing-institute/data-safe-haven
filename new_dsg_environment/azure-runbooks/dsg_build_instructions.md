# Data Study Environment Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

### Access to required Safe Haven Management resources

- Access to the relevant Safe Haven Management Azure subscription

- Administrative access to the relevant Safe Haven Management Active Directory Domain

- Administrative access to the relevant Safe Haven Management VMs

- #### Download a client VPN certificate for the Safe Haven Management VNet

  - Navigate to the Safe Haven Management (SHM) KeyVault in the Safe Haven Management subscription via `Resource Groups -> RG_DSG_SECRETS -> dsg-management-<shm-id>`, where `<shm-id>` is `prod` for the production SHM environment and `test` for the test SHM environment.

  - Once there open the "Certificates" page under the "Settings" section in the left hand sidebar.

  - Click on the certificate named `DSG-P2S-<shm-id>-ClientCert`, click on the "current version" and click the "Download in PFX/PEM format" link.

  - To install, double click on the downloaded certificate, leaving the password field blank.

  - **Make sure to securely delete the "\*.pfx" certificate file after you have installed it.**

  -  This certificate will also allow you to connect via VPN to the DSG VNet once deployed.

- #### Configure a VPN connection to the Safe Haven Management VNet

  - Navigate to the Safe Haven Management (SHM) VNet gateway in the SHM subscription via `Resource Groups -> RG_DSG_VNET -> DSG_VNET1_GW`. Once there open the "Point-to-site configuration page under the "Settings" section in the left hand sidebar (see image below).

  - Click the "Download VPN client" link at the top of the page to get the root certificate (VpnServerRoot.cer) and VPN configuration file (VpnSettings.xml), then follow the [VPN set up instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert) using the Windows or Mac sections as appropriate.

  - Note that on OSX double clicking on the root certificate may not result in any pop-up dialogue, but the certificate should still be installed. You can view the details of the downloaded certificate by highlighting the certificate file in Finder and pressing the spacebar. You can then look for the certificate of the same name in the login KeyChain and view it's details by double clicking the list entry. If the details match the certificate has been successfully installed.

  - Continue to follow the set up instructions from the link above, using SSTP (Windows) or IKEv2 (OSX) for the VPN type and naming the VPN connection "Safe Haven Management Gateway (`<shm-id>`)", where `<shm-id>` is `prod` for the production SHM environment and `test` for the test SHM environment.

### Access to required DSG resources

- Access to a new Azure subscription which the DSG will be deployed to

- Access to a public routable domain name for the DSG and its name servers

### Install and configure PowerShell for Azure

- [Install PowerShell v 6.0 or above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6)

- [Install the PowerShell Azure commandlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-1.3.0)

## Build Process

0. Define DSG configuration

1. Prepare the management environment for the new DSG

2. Deploy DSG Virtual Network

3. Deploy DSG Domain Controller

4. Deploy Remote Desktop Services environment

5. Deploy Data Server

6. Deploy Support Servers (GitLab, HackMD)

7. Deploy initial shared compute VM

8. Network Lock Down

## 0. Define DSG configuration

The full configuration details for a new DSG are generated by defining a few "core" properties for the new DSG and the management environment in which it will be deployed.

### Core SHM configuration properties
The core properties for the relevant pre-existing Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment must be present in the `dsg_configs/core` folder.
The following core SHM properties must be defined in a JSON file named `shm_<shm-id>_core_config.json`.

```json
{
    "subscriptionName": "Name of the Azure subscription the management environment is deployed in",
    "domain": "The fully qualified domain name for the management environment",
    "shId": "A short ID to identify the management environment",
    "location": "The Azure location in which the management environment VMs are deployed",
    "ipPrefix": "The three octect IP address prefix for the Class A range used by the management environemnt",
    "dcHostname": "The hostname of the managment environemtn Active Directory Domain Controller"
}
```

### Core DSG configuration properties

The core properties for the new DSG environment must be present in the `dsg_configs/core` folder.
The following core DSG properties must be defined in a JSON file named `dsg_<dsg-id>_core_config.json`.

```json
{
    "subscriptionName": "Name of the Azure subscription the DSG environment is deployed in",
    "dsgId": "A short ID to identify the management environment",
    "domain": "The fully qualified domain name for the DSG environment",
    "ipPrefix": "The three octect IP address prefix for the Class A range used by the management environemnt"
}
```

#### DSG IP Address prefix

Each DSG must be assigned it's own unique IP address space, and it is very important that address spaces do not overlap in the environment as this will cause network faults. The address spaces use a private class A range and use a 21bit subnet mask. This provides ample addresses for a DSG and capacity to add additional subnets should that be required in the future.

### Generate full configuration for DSG

- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).

- Navigate to the `new_dsg_environment/dsg_deploy_scripts/` folder within the Safe Haven repository.

- Generate a new full configuration file for the new DSG using the following commands.
  - `Import-Module ./DsgConfig.psm1 -Force`
  - `Add-DsgConfig -shmId <sh-management-id> -dsgId <dsg-id>` (`<sh-management-id>` is  `test` or `prod`, `<dsg-id>` is usually a number, e.g. `9` for `DSG9`),
  - A full configuration file for the new DSG will be created at `new_dsg_environment/dsg_configs/full/dsg_<dsg-id>_full_config.json`. This file is used by the subsequent steps in the DSG deployment.

## 0. Prepare Safe Haven Management Domain
- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven]{.underline}](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).

- Change to the `new_dsg_environment/dsg_deploy_scripts/01_configure_shm_dc/` directory within the Safe Haven repository.

- Ensure you are logged into the Azure within PowerShell using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`

- Ensure the active subscription is set to that you are using for the new DSG environment using the command: `Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<dsg-subscription-name>"` [TODO: Write a small script to pick this up from the DSG config file (or have all DSG scripts switch subscriptions when they run)]

- Add new DSG users and security group to the AD by running `Create_New_DSG_User_Service_Accounts_Local.ps1`, entering the DSG ID when prompted

- Add new DSG DNS record to the AD by running `Add_New_DSG_To_DNS_Local.ps1`, entering the DSG ID when prompted

## 1. Deploy Virtual Network

### Create the virtual network

- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).

- Change to the `new_dsg_environment/dsg_deploy_scripts/02_create_vnet/` directory within the Safe Haven repository.

- Ensure you are logged into the Azure within PowerShell using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`

- Ensure the active subscription is set to that you are using for the new DSG environment using the command: `Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<dsg-subscription-name>"`

- Run the `./Create_VNET.ps1` script, providing the DSG ID when prompted.

- The deployment will take around 20 minutes. Most of this is deploying the virtual network gateway.

### Create Peering Connection with the management virtual network

- Once the virtual network is created, a peer connection is required between the management and DSG virtual networks

- From the Azure portal go to the **SHM subscription** and open the management virtual network at `Resource Groups -> RG_SHM_VNET -> DSG_<shm-slug>_VNET1`, where `<shm-slug>` is `DSGROUPDEV` for the test environment and `SHM` for the production environment.

- Select "**Peerings"** from the left-hand navigation

- Add a new "Peering"

- Configure the Peering as follows:

  - Name: `PEER_DSG_DSGROUP<dsg-id>_VNET1`

  - Subscription: Select the new DSG subscription

  - Virtual Network: Select the newly created virtual network (`DSG_DSGROUP<dsg-id>_VNET1`)

  - Set "Allow virtual network access" to "Enabled" and leave the remaining checkboxes **un**checked

    ![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1c7f094.PNG](images/media/image2.png)

- Change to the new **DSG subscription**, open the virtual network at `Resource groups -> RG_DSG_VNET -> DSG_DSGROUP<dsg-id>_VNET1`

- Select "**Peerings"** from the left-hand navigation

- Add a new "Peering"

- Configure the Peering as follows:

  - Name: `PEER_<shm-slug>_VNET1`, where `<shm-slug>` is `DSGROUPDEV` for the test environment and `SHM` for the production environment.

  - Subscription: Select the Safe Haven management subscription

  - Virtual Network: Select the SHM virtual network (`DSG_<shm-slug>_VNET1`)

  - Set "Allow virtual network access" to "Enabled" and leave the remaining checkboxes **un**checked

    ![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1d02087.PNG](images/media/image3.png)

- Once provisioned the networks will be connected.

- In the **DSG subscription** open `Resource Groups -> RG_DSG_VNET -> DSG_VNET1_GW`
  
  - Select "**Point to Site Configuration**" fromt he left-hand navigation

  - Download the VPN client from the "Point to Site configuration" menu

    ![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1dfd680.PNG](images/media/image4.png)

  - Install the VPN on your PC and test. See the [Configure a VPN connection to the Safe Haven Management VNet](#Configure-a-VPN-connection-to-the-Safe-Haven-Management-VNet) section in the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) list above for instructions. You can re-use the same client certificate as used for the VPN to the management VNet gateway.

## 3. Deploy DSG Domain Controller

### Deploy DC VM

- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).

### Configure DNS record for RDS server

To make this Remote Desktop Service accessible from the internet an `A` record will need to be added to the DNS Zone for the domain associated with the DSG.

- Create a DNS zone for the DSG in the SHM subscription at `Resource Groups -> RG_SH_DNS -> dgroup<dsg-id>.co.uk`. - Create an `A` record with the name `rds` and as its value matching the external IP address that is assigned to the "RDS_NIC1" resource within the Azure Portal. 

#### Configuration of SSL on RDS Gateway

The next step is to install a SSL Certificate onto the RDS Gateway server. This has to be a certificate that is issued from a Certificate Authority and not self-signed.

##### Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

- Connect to the **DSG Remote Desktop Gateway (RDS)** server via Remote Desktop client over the DSG VPN connection. Ensure that the Remote Desktop client configuration shares a folder on your local machine with the RDS Gateway.

- Login with domain user `<shm-domain>\atiadmin` and the **DSG DC** admin password from the SHM KeyVault (all DSG Windows servers use the same admin credentials)

- From the Server Manager dashboard select `Tools -> Internet Information Service (IIS) Manager`

-	Open “Server Certificates” and click “Create Certificate Request”

- Fill in the form as below. It is **critically important** that the certificate common name matches the FQDN of the RDS server i.e. `rds.dsgroup<dsg-id>.co.uk`.

  ![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1f40510.PNG](images/media/image16.png)

- Set the "Bit length" to 2048 (this can be set higher but check with your CA provider)

  ![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1f63406.PNG](images/media/image17.png)

- Save the certificate request file to a TXT file to be used to order the SSL Certificate.

- Copy the CSR from the RDS server to the folder on your local computer that you shared with the RDS Gateway when you connected to it.

##### Get an SSL certificate issued by a CA for the RDS server

###### A. Use Let's Encrypt as the CA

  -   [Install Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) on your computer if required

  -   Run Certbot, passing in custom folders for config, work and logs directories. This will automatically create a new Let\'s Encrypt account for this particular pairing of Certbot installation and custom directory.

  -   `certbot --config-dir ~/tsh-certbot/config --work-dir ~/tsh-certbot/work --logs-dir ~/tsh-certbot/logs certonly --manual --preferred-challenges "dns" --agree-tos -m <email-for-expiry-notifications> -d <rds-fqdn> --csr <path-to-csr>`, where `<rds-fqdn>` is the fully qualified domain name of the RDS server (e.g. `rds.dsgroup10.co.uk`)

  -   When presented with the DNS challenge from Certbot, add a record to the DNS Zone for the DSG domain with the following properties. The DNS Zone is located in the SHM subscription at `Resource Groups -> RG_DSG_DNS -> dgroup<dsg-id>.co.uk`).

      -   **Name:** `_acme-challenge.rds`)

      -   **Type: TXT

      -   **TTL:*** 30 seconds

      -   **Value:** The value provided by Certbot (a long random looking string)

    -   Wait for Let\'s Encrypt to verify the challenge

    -   Copy `~/tsh-certbot/config/live/<dsg-fq-domain\>/fullchain.pem` to the folder on your local computer that you shared with the RDS Gateway when you connected to it.

    -   Securely delete the `~/tsh-certbot` directory. Note that, when using a CSR, neither the CSR nor the signed certificate files are sensitive. However, the private key in the `accounts` subfolder is now authorised to create new certs for the DSG domain, which is sensitive

##### Install the CA certificate on the RDS Server

 Once the certificate has been issued by the CA this needs to be installed onto the server.

 - Connect to the **DSG Remote Desktop Gateway (RDS)** server via Remote Desktop client over the DSG VPN connection. Ensure that the Remote Desktop client configuration shares a folder on your local machine with the RDS Gateway.

- Login with domain user `<shm-domain>\atiadmin` and the **DSG DC** admin password from the SHM KeyVault (all DSG Windows servers use the same admin credentials)

- From the Server Manager dashboard select "Tools -> Internet Information Service (IIS) Manager"
 
- Open Certificates and select "Complete Certificate Request"

- Browse to the folder that you shared with the RDS Gateway from your local computer when you connected to it.

- Select the certificate file provided by the CA

- Set the friendly name to match the common name you provided in the certificate request (i.e. `dsgroup<dsg-id>.co.uk`).

  ![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1f92aff.PNG](images/media/image18.png)

- Click "OK" to complete the process

- Open "MMC" and add the "Certificates" snap-in targeting the "Computer Account" on the local computer

- Expand `Personal -> Certificates` and locate the CA certificate

- Export the certificate with it's private key

  - Right click this certificate and click on `All Tasks -> Export`

  - Select "Yes, export the private key" and click "Next"
  
  - Select the "Personal Information Exchange" format and click "Next"
  
  - Check the "Password" box, enter a password and click "Next"
  
  - Click "Browse", select a location to save the certificate and provide a name. Click "Next" then "Finish"

- Export the certificate without it's private key

  - Right click this certificate and click on `All Tasks -> Export`

  - Select "No, do not export the private key" and click "Next"
  
  - Select the "DER encoded binary X.509" format and click "Next"
  
  - Check the "Password" box, enter a password and click "Next"
  
  - Click "Browse", select a location to save the certificate and provide a name. Click "Next" then "Finish"

- Open a PowerShell command window with elevated privileges - make sure to use the `Windows PowerShell` application, **not** the `Windows PowerShell (x86)` application. The required server managment commandlets are not installe don the `x86` version.

- Navigate to C:\\Scripts

- Add the new certificate and private key to the Remote Desktop service by running the following command:

  |  **Command** |     **Parameters** |   **Description** |
  | -- | -- | -- |
  |  `AddSSLCert.ps1`  | -Sslpassword |     The private key password |
  | |                   -domain |          Enter the NetBIOS name of the domain i.e. DSGROUP`<dsg-id>` |
  | |                   -certpath |        The path to the `.pfx` file you exported the certificate **including** private key to earlier|

### Configure Remote Desktop Web Client on the RDS Gateway

- Scroll down to "For setting up different data storing directory"

- Add the following under the "git\_data\_dir" entry

` git\_data\_dirs({ \"default\" =\> { \"path\" =\> \"/media/gitdata\" } })`

- Insure that EOS is at the end of the file and save it.

![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1aee41b.PNG](images/media/image35.png)

- Run the following command to reconfigure server:

```console
> sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
 ```

Do an LDAP check:

```console
> sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:ldap:check
```

- Login to server via browser, the first password prompt sets the Root password

- Go to settings and switch off user sign up

![C:\\Users\\ROB\~1.CLA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1e3d554.PNG](images/media/image37.png)

- Set restricted domain to FQDN of domain, ensure that the local DSG domain and management domain are added.

- Upgrade GitLab

 ```console
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce=9.5.6-ce.0
> sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
> sudo gitlab-ctl restart
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce=10.8.7-ce.0
> sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
> sudo gitlab-ctl restart
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt upgrade
> sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
> sudo gitlab-ctl restart
```

## Deploy sahred Compute VM
See the [Compute VM build and deployment guide](../azure-vms/README.md).
- Ensure you have carried out the steps in the "Pre-requistites" section
- Update the `deploy_compute_vm_to_turing_dsg.sh` script with the details of the new DSG.
  - Add the new <dsg-id> to the "Check DSG group ID is valid" line
  - Amend the "Set defaults for test and production environments" section to set the right defaults for the new DSG
  - Amend the "Overwite defaults for per-DSG settings" section to set the right DSG specific parameter values
- Deploy a new VM using `./deploy_compute_vm_to_turing_dsg.sh -g <dsg-id> -q 160`
as per the "Safe deployment to a Turing DSG environment" section


## Network Lock Down

- Once all the VMs have been deployed and updated before the DSG is ready the network on the RDS Session servers and Linux servers needs locking down to prevent them from accessing the internet.

- Open the Azure Portal

- Locate the "Network Security Groups" management pane.

- RDS Servers

  - Open "NSG_SessionHosts"

  - Associate the following NICs to this NSG

    - RDSSH1_NIC1

    - RDSSH2_NIC2

- Linux Servers

  - Open NSG_Linux_Servers

  - Associate the following NICs to this NSG

    - GITLAB_NIC1

    - HACKMD_NIC1

## Sever administration

- The following servers are created as a result of these instructions:
  - DSGxDC (domain controller)
  - DATASERVER
  - HACKMD
  - GITLAB
  - RDS
  - RDSSH1
  - RDSSH2
  - An initial shared compute VM
