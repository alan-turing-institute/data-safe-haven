# Reference guides

Our reference material for how to implement some technical aspect of our Safe Haven.

The current implementation of our Safe Haven requires Microsoft Azure. References for how to use Azure can be found on the [Microsoft Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) or the [Azure web portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/azure-portal/).

These reference guides assume some knowledge of how our Safe Havens work.
