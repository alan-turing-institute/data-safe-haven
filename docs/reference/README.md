# Reference guides

Our reference material for how to implement some technical aspect of our Safe Haven.

We currently only have an azure implementation of our Safe Havens, thus a lot of reference material can be found on the [Microsoft azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) or the [Azure web portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/azure-portal/).

These reference guides assume some knowledge of how our Safe Havens work.
