## :beginner: Introduction: The Turing Safe Haven

Welcome to the Turing Safe Haven!

Secure research environments (SREs) for analysis of sensitive datasets are essential to give data providers confidence that their datasets will be kept secure over the course of a project.
The Turing Safe Haven is a prescription for how to set up one or more SREs and give users access to them.
The Safe Haven SRE design is aimed at allowing groups of researchers to work together on projects that involve sensitive or confidential datasets at scale.
Our goal is to ensure that you are able to implement the most cutting edge data science techniques while maintaining all ethical and legal responsibilities of information governance and access.

The data you are working on will have been classified into one of five sensitivity tiers, ranging from open data at Tier 0, to highly sensitive and high risk data at Tier 4.
The tiers are defined by the most sensitive data in your project, and may be increased if the combination of data is deemed to be require additional levels of security.
You can read more about this process in our policy paper: *Arenas et al, 2019*, [`arXiv:1908.08737`](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08737>).

The level of sensitivity of your data determines whether you have access to the internet within the SRE and whether you are allowed to copy and paste between the secure research environment and other windows on your computer.
This means you may be limited in which data science tools you are allowed to install.
You will find that many software packages are already available, and the administrator of the SRE will ingress - bring into the environment - as many additional resources as possible.

**Please read this user guide carefully and remember to refer back to it when you have questions.**
In many cases the answer is already here, but if you think this resource could be clearer, please let us know so we can improve the documentation for future users.

### :calendar: Definitions

The following definitions might be useful during the rest of this guide

> **Secure Research Environment (SRE)**: the environment that you will be using to access the sensitive data.
>
> **Turing Safe Haven**: the overall project that details how to create and manage one or more SREs.
>
> **Username domain**: the domain (for example `apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` ) which your user account will belong to. Multiple SREs can share the same domain for managing users in common. We we will call this `<username domain>` in the rest of this document
>
> **SRE URL**: each SRE has a dedicated URL (for example `sandbox.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` ) which is used to access the data. We will call this full URL the `<SRE URL>` in the rest of this document, and we will call the initial part of the URL the `<SRE ID>` (i.e. `sandbox` in this example).

## :rocket: Set up your account

This section of the user guide will help you set up your new account on the SRE which you'll be using.

### :seedling: Prerequisites

Make sure you have all of the following in front of you when connecting to the SRE.

+ :e-mail: The email from your SRE administrator with your account details.
+ :wrench: Your [username](#username), given in an email from your SRE administrator.
+ :european_castle: The [domain name and URL](#domain-names) for the SRE, given in an email from your SRE administrator.
+ :computer: Your computer.
+ :satellite: [Access](#network-access) to the specific wired or wireless network detailed in the email from your SRE administrator.
+ :iphone: Your [phone](#your-phone-for-multi-factor-authentication), with good signal connectivity.

You should also know who the **designated contact** for your SRE is.
This might be an administrator or one of the people working on the project with you.
They will be your primary point of contact if you have any issues in connecting to or using the SRE.

> :information_source: For example, during the Turing Data Study Groups, the facilitator of each SRE is the designated contact

#### Username

Your username will usually be in the format `firstname.lastname`
In some places, you will need to enter it in the form `username@<username domain>`
> :point_right: You can find your username in the email you received from the SRE administrator.

> :pencil2: If you have a hyphenated last name, or multiple surnames, or a long family name, your assigned username may not follow the same pattern of `firstname.lastname` .
> Please check with the designated contact for your SRE if you are unsure about your username.
>
> :information_source: In this document we will use Ada Lovelace as our example user.
> Her username is `ada.lovelace` or `ada.lovelace@apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` if the long-form is needed.

#### Network access

The SRE that you're using may be configured to allow access only from a specific set of IP addresses.
This may involve being connected to a specific wired or wireless network or using a VPN.
You also may be required to connect from a specific, secure location.
You will be told what these requirements are for your particular environment.

> :point_right: Make sure you know the networks from which you must connect to your SRE.
> This information will be available in the email you received with your connection information.

#### Your phone for multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is one of the most powerful ways of verifying user identity online.
We therefore use MFA to protect the project data - specifically, we will use your phone number.

> :point_right: Make sure to have your phone with you and that you have good signal connectivity when you are connecting to the SRE.
>
> :pencil2: You may encounter some connectivity challenges if your phone network has poor connectivity.
> The SRE is not set up to allow you to authenticate through other methods.

#### Domain names

You should be given the username domain in the initial email from your SRE administrator.
You might receive the SRE URL at this time, or you might be assigned to a particular SRE at a later point.

> :information_source: In this document Ada Lovelace - our example user - will be participating in a Turing Data Study Group held in April 2020.
> Her **username domain** is `apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` .
> Her **SRE URL** is `https://sandbox.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` .

### :closed_lock_with_key: Set a password

For security reasons, you must reset your password before you log in for the first time.
Please follow these steps carefully.

+ Open a private/incognito browser session on your computer.

    > :pencil2: One of the most common problems that users have in connecting to the SRE is automatic completion of usernames and passwords from other accounts on their computer.
    > This can be quite confusing, particularly for anyone who logs into Microsoft services for work or personal use.
    >
    > :warning: Look out for usernames or passwords that are automatically completed, and make sure that you're using the correct details needed to access the SRE.

+ Copy and paste the following URL into the private browser address bar: `https://aka.ms/mfasetup` .

   This short link starts the process of logging into your account.

+ At the login prompt enter `username@<username domain>` and confirm/proceed.

   Remember that your username will probably be in the format `firstname.lastname` .

   > :information_source: Our example user, Ada Lovelace, participating in the April 2020 Data Study Group, would enter `ada.lovelace@apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk`
+ There will then be a password prompt.

   The first time you log in you need to click **"Forgotten my password"**.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/resetpassword_1.png" width="80%" title="Forgotten my password"/>
   </p>

   > :warning: If you reset your password, you will need to wait 5-10 mins before logging in again, to allow the user management system to sync up with the new password.

+ Fill out the requested CAPTCHA (your username should be pre-filled).

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/resetpassword_2.png" width="80%" title="CAPTCHA"/>
   </p>

+ Confirm your phone number, which you provided to the SRE administrator when you registered for access to the environment.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/resetpassword_3.png" width="80%" title="resetpassword_3"/>
   </p>

+ Select a password.

   > :point_right: Your password must comply with the following requirements:

  + alphanumeric
  + minimum 12 characters
  + at least one each of:
    + :capital_abcd: uppercase character
    + :abcd: lowercase character
    + :1234: number
  + you should choose a unique password for the SRE to ensure it is secure

   We recommend using this [Secure Password Generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/?length=20&symbols=0&numbers=1&lowercase=1&uppercase=1&similar=1&ambiguous=0&client=1&autoselect=1) to create a password that meets these requirements. This will ensure that the password is different from any others that you might use and that it is unlikely to be on any list of commonly used passwords.

  :information_source: Note that when setting your password, the [Microsoft Azure AD password requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy) will be enforced - any password which fulfils the requirements above will pass this validation.

   > :warning: Do not use special characters or symbols in your password.
   > The virtual keyboard inside the SRE may not be the same as your physical keyboard and this can make it difficult to type some symbols.

   We recommend using a password manager (for example [BitWarden](<https://bitwarden.com>) to store your password.
   Alternatively you can write down your password on a piece of paper and keep it securely on your person, or store the password on a separate machine.

+ Enter your password into the `Enter new password` and `Confirm new password` fields.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/resetpassword_4.png" width="80%" title="resetpassword_4"/>
   </p>

   Then continue to the next step

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/resetpassword_5.png" width="80%" title="resetpassword_5"/>
   </p>

+ Log into your account when prompted and at this point you will be asked for additional security verification.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/more_information_required.png" width="80%" title="more_information_required">
   </p>

### :door: Set up multi-factor authentication

The next step in setting up your account is to authenticate your account from your phone.
This additional security verification is to make it harder for people to impersonate you and connect to the environment without permission.

+ Choose how you would like to be contacted for the additional security verification.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="../../images/user_guide/additional_security_verification.png" width="80%" title="additional_security_verification"/>
  </p>

  + If you select phone verification, go to step 2.
  + If you select app verification, go to step 3.

+ :telephone_receiver: **Phone option**:

   If you choose to set up the authentication by phone call you will receive a call straight away.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/setup_mfa_phone_1.png" width="80%" title="setup_mfa_phone_1"/>
   </p>

   > :pencil2: Note that some people get a call that says, *press the pound key* and others receive *press the hash key* – both mean hit the `#` button.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/setup_mfa_phone_2.png" width="80%" title="setup_mfa_phone_2">
   </p>

   When you click `close` the page will switch to your dashboard.

+ :iphone: **App option**:

  Select the `Receive notifications for verification` radio button.

  Click `Set up` .

  Download the Microsoft Authenticator app via one of these links:

  + :apple: iOS: `https://bit.ly/iosauthenticator`
  + :bust_in_silhouette: Android: `https://bit.ly/androidauthenticator`
  + :checkered_flag: Windows mobile: `https://bit.ly/windowsauthenticator`

  > :warning: You must give permission for the authenticator app to send you notifications for the app to work as an MFA method.

  Open the Microsoft Authenticator app on your phone:

  + Select `Add an account`
  + Select `Work or School account`
  + Scan the QR code on the screen

  <p align="center">
    <img src="../../images/user_guide/setup_mfa_app_1.png" width="80%" title="setup_mfa_app_1"/>
  </p>

  + Click `Next` to start verification

  <p align="center">
    <img src="../../images/user_guide/setup_mfa_app_2.png" width="80%" title="setup_mfa_app_2"/>
  </p>

  + Click `Next` again to test the app, you will get a verification on your app.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="../../images/user_guide/setup_mfa_app_3.png" width="80%" title="setup_mfa_app_3"/>
  </p>

+ Check that your MFA is completed.

    > :warning: It is confusing that the "save" button is not available to click, but if your phone or app appears on this screen you **are** set up for MFA.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/setup_mfa_app_4.png" width="80%" title="setup_mfa_app_4"/>
   </p>

   Close the browser once MFA is confirmed.

#### Troubleshooting MFA

Sometimes setting up MFA can be problematic.
You may find the following tips helpful:

+ :inbox_tray: Make sure you allow notifications on your authenticator app.
+ :sleeping: Check you don't have *Do not Disturb* mode on.
+ :zap: You have to be SUPER FAST at acknowledging the notification on your app, since the access codes update every 30 seconds.
+ :confused: Sometimes just going through the steps again solves the problem

## :unlock: Access the Secure Research Environment

### :seedling: Prerequisites

After going through the account setup procedure, you should have access to:

+ Your `username`
+ Your `password`
+ The SRE URL name
+ Multifactor authentication

> :point_right: If you aren't sure about any of these then please return to the [**Set up your account**](#rocket-set-up-your-account) section above.

### :house: Log into the research environment

+ Open a private/incognito browser session, so that you don't pick up any existing Microsoft logins

+ Go to the `<SRE URL>` given by your SRE administrator.

   > :information_source: Our example user, Ada Lovelace, participating in the April 2020 Data Study Group, would navigate to `https://sandbox.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` .
   >
   > :point_right: Don't forget the **https://** as you will not be able to login without it at the start of the URL!

+ You should arrive at a login page that looks like this.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/logon_environment.PNG" width="80%" title="logon_environment">
   </p>

   Enter your username (either as `username` or as `username@<username domain>` ) and password here, then click `Sign in` .

   > :information_source: Our example user, Ada Lovelace, participating in the April 2020 Data Study Group, would enter `ada.lovelace` in the User name box, enter her password and then click `Sign in` .

+ If you are successful, you'll see the a screen with icons for the available apps.

   </p>

   Welcome to the Turing Safe Haven SRE! :wave:

### :penguin: Log into the Linux Data Science desktop

The primary method of performing data analysis in the SRE is using the Linux data science desktop.

This is a virtual machine (VM) with many different applications and programming languages pre-installed on it.
Once connected to it, you can carry out data science research while remaining completely isolated from the internet.

+ Click on the `DSVM Main (Desktop)` app to start running the desktop.

   You will now **receive a call or mobile app notification** to authenticate using MFA.

   :telephone_receiver: For the call, you may have to move to an area with good reception and/or press the hash ( `#` ) key multiple times in-call.

   :iphone: For the app you will see a notification saying _"You have received a sign in verification request"_.
   Go to the app to approve the request.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_connection_screen.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_connection_screen"/>
   </p>

   > :warning: If you don't respond to the MFA request quickly enough, or if it fails, you will likely get an error that looks like this:

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_connection_failure.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_connection_failure"/>
   </p>

+ After verifying using MFA, you might get a security alert like this one. If you do, it is safe to tick the box and to click `Yes` .

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_security_fingerprint.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_security_fingerprint"/>
   </p>

+ Insert your username and password.

    > :information_source: Our example user, Ada Lovelace, would enter `ada.lovelace` and her password.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_login_screen.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_login_screen"/>
   </p>

   If you enter your username and / or password incorrect you will see a warning:

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_login_failure.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_login_failure"/>
   </p>

   > :point_right: Please try again, entering your username and password carefully.
   >
   > :warning: If you have special characters in your password, your keyboard mapping may be incorrect.
   > We recommend _not_ including these characters in your password.
   > You can re-set your password using the steps defined in the [**Set your password**](#set-your-password) section above.
   > To check that the characters you are typing are being interpreted correctly, try entering these special characters into the username field, so that you can read them as you enter them.

+ You should now be greeted by a Linux desktop.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_desktop_initial.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_desktop_initial"/>
   </p>

You are now inside the Turing Safe Haven SRE!
Welcome :wave:

## :computer: Develop analyses via the Linux Data Science desktop

You can use the Linux Data Science desktop to carry out data science research on the data that has been made available to you.
You can work with any of the pre-installed applications and programming languages.

+ Installed programming languages / compilers include:
  + `.Net`
  + `C`
  + `C++`
  + `Fortran`
  + `Java`
  + `Julia`
  + `Python`
  + `R`
  + `scala`
+ Editors / IDEs include:
  + `atom`
  + `emacs`
  + `nano`
  + `PyCharm`
  + `RStudio`
  + `Spyder`
  + `vim`
  + `Visual Studio Code`
+ Database access through the following applications:
  + `Azure Data Studio`
  + `DBeaver`
  + `psql`
+ Writing tools include:
  + `LaTeX` and `TeXStudio` for technical writing
  + `LibreOffice` for creating presentations
+ Other applications include:
  + `firefox`
  + `git`

If you need anything that is not already installed, please discuss this with the designated contact for your SRE.

> :point_right: This desktop is your interface to a "virtual machine".
> You may have access to [additional virtual machines](#-access-additional-virtual-machines) so be careful to check which machine you are working in as files and installed packages may not be the same across the machines.

### :musical_keyboard: Keyboard mapping

When you access the Data Science desktop you are actually connecting through "the cloud" to another computer - via a few intermediate computers / servers that monitor and maintain the security of the SRE.

> :warning: You may find that the keyboard mapping on your computer is not the same as the one in the SRE.

Click on `Desktop` and `Applications > Settings > Keyboard` to change the layout.

> :point_right: We recommend opening a text editor (such as `Atom` , see [Access applications](#access-applications) below) to check what keys the remote desktop thinks you're typing – especially if you need to use special characters.

### :unlock: Access applications

You can access applications from the desktop in two ways: the terminal or via a drop down menu.

Applications can be accessed from the dropdown menu.
For example:

+ `Applications` -> `Development` -> `RStudio`
+ `Applications` -> `Development` -> `Atom`

Applications can be accessed from a terminal.
For example:

+ Open Terminal -> `jupyter notebook &` if you want to use python within a jupyter notebook.
+ Open Terminal -> `spyder &` if you want to use python within the Spyder IDE (integrated development environment) which is quite similar to RStudio.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../images/user_guide/access-applications.png" width="80%" title="screen capture to show how to access applications from the desktop"/>
</p>

### :snake: Initiate the correct version of R or python

Typing `R` at the command line will give you the system version of `R` with many custom packages pre-installed.

There are several versions of `python` installed, which are managed through [pyenv](<https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>).
You can see the default version (indicated by a '*') and all other installed versions using the following command:

``` bash
> pyenv versions
```

This will give output like:

``` bash
  system
  3.6.11
  3.7.8
* 3.8.3 (set by /home/ada.lovelace/.pyenv_version)
```

You can change your preferred Python version globally or on a folder-by-folder basis using

+ `pyenv global <version number>` (to change the version globally)
+ `pyenv local <version number>` (to change the version for the folder you are currently in)

### :gift: Install R and python packages

There are local copies of the `PyPI` and `CRAN` package repositories available within the Turing SRE.

You can install packages you need from these copies in the usual way, for example `pip install` and `packages.install` for Python and R respectively.

> :warning: Note that you will not have access to install packages system-wide and will therefore need to install packages in a user directory.

+ For `CRAN` , you will be prompted to make a user package directory when you [install your first package](#r-packages).
+ For `PyPI` , you will need to [install using the `--user` argument to `pip`](#python-packages).

#### R packages

You can install `R` packages from inside `R` (or `RStudio` ):

``` R
> install.packages(<package-name>)
```

You will see:

``` R
Installing package into '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library'
(as 'lib' is unspecified)
Warning in install.packages("cluster") :
  'lib = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"' is not writable
Would you like to use a personal library instead? (yes/No/cancel)
```

Enter `yes` , which prompts you to confirm the name of the library:

``` R
Would you like to create a personal library
'~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5'
to install packages into? (yes/No/cancel)
```

Enter `yes` , which then installs the packages:

``` R
trying URL 'http://10.1.0.21/src/contrib/cluster_2.0.7-1.tar.gz'
```

#### Python packages

You can install `python` packages from a terminal.

``` bash
pip install --user <package-name>
```

> :warning: Don't forget the `--user` flag as you do not have permission to install packages for all users.

#### Package availability

Depending on the type of data you are accessing, different `R` and `python` packages will be available to you (in addition to the ones that are pre-installed):

+ Tier-2 (medium security) environments have full mirrors of `PyPI` and `CRAN` available.
+ Tier-3 (high security) environments only have pre-authorised "whitelisted" packages available.

If you need to use a package that is not on the approved whitelist see the section on how to [Bring in software or data to the environment](#bring-in-software-or-data-to-the-environment) below.

## :link: Share files with collaborators

### :open_file_folder: Shared directories within the SRE

There are several shared areas on the data science machine that all collaborators within a research project team can see and access:

+ [input data](#input-data-data): `/data/`
+ [shared space](#shared-space-shared): `/shared/`
+ [scratch space](#scratch-space-scratch): `/scratch/`
+ [output resources](#output-resources-output): `/output/`

#### Input data: `/data/`

Data that has been "ingressed" - approved and brought into the secure research environment - can be found in the `/data/` folder.

Everyone in your group will be able to access it, but it is **read-only**.

> :point_right: You will not be able to change any of the files in `/data/` .
> If you want to make derived datasets, for example cleaned and reformatted data, please add those to the `/shared/` or `/output/` directories.

The contents of `/data/` will be **identical** on all virtual machines in your SRE.
For example, if your group requests a GPU-enabled machine, this will contain an identical `/data/` folder.

> :pencil2: If you are participating in a Turing Data Study Group you will find example slides and document templates in the `/data/` drive.

#### Shared space: `/shared/`

The `/shared/` folder should be used for any work that you want to share with your group.

Everyone in your group will be able to access it, and will have **read-and-write access**.

The contents of `/shared/` will be **identical** on all virtual machines in your SRE.
For example, if your group requests a GPU-enabled machine, this will contain an identical `/shared/` folder.

#### Scratch space: `/scratch/`

The `/scratch/` folder should be used for any work-in-progress that isn't ready to share yet.

Although everyone in your group will have **read-and-write access**, you can create your own folders inside `/scratch` and choose your own permissions for them.

The contents of `/scratch/` will be **different** on different VMs in your SRE.
For example, if your group requests a GPU-enabled machine, this will have its own `/scratch/` folder.

#### Output resources: `/output/`

Any outputs that you want to extract from the secure environment should be placed in the `/output/` folder on the data science linux desktop.

Everyone in your group will be able to access it, and will have **read-and-write access**.

Anything placed in here will be considered for data egress - removal from the secure research environment - by the project's principal investigator together with the data provider.

> :point_right: You may want to consider having subfolders of `/output/` to make the reivew of this directory easier.
>
> :information_source: For the Turing Data Study Groups, we recommend the following categories:

> + Presentation
> + Transformed data/derived data
> + Report
> + Code

### :newspaper: Bring in new files to the SRE

Bringing software into a secure research environment may constitute a security risk.
Bringing new data into the SRE may mean that the environment needs to be updated to a more secure tier.

The review of the "ingress" of new code or data will be coordinated by the designated contact for your SRE.
They will have to discuss whether this is an acceptable risk to the data security with the project's principle investigator and data provider and the decision might be "no".

> :point_right: You can make the process as easy as possible by providing as much information as possible about the code or data you'd like to bring into the environment and about how it is to be used.

## :couple: Collaborate on code using GitLab

GitLab is an open source version of GitHub, a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects, using git to **version control** your work, coordinating tasks using GitLab **issues** and reviewing work using GitLab **merge requests**.

As GitLab make all their source code publicly available for reuse, anyone can host their own version of GitLab.
So while there is a central service run by the GitLab organisation at https://gitlab.com, an organisation can run their own version - which looks exactly the same - at their own web address.

The GitLab instance within the SRE can contain code, documentation and results from you and your team's analyses.
You do not need to worry about the security of the information you upload there as it is fully contained within the SRE and there is no access to the internet and / or external servers.

### :books: Maintaining an archive of the project

The Turing Safe Haven SRE uses virtual machines hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
One of the benefits of having cloud based infastructure is that it can be deleted forever when the project is over.
Deleting the infrastructure ensures that neither sensitive data nor insights derived from the data or modelling techniques persist.

Make sure that every piece of code you think might be useful is stored in a GitLab repository within the secure environment.
Any other work should be transferred to the shared `/shared/` drive.
Anything that you think should be considered for **egress** from the environment (eg. images or processed datasets) should be transferred to the shared `/output/` drive.

> :warning: If you are participating in a Turing Data Study Group, everything that is not stored in a GitLab repository or on the shared `/shared/` or `/output/` drives by Friday lunchtime will be **DESTROYED FOR EVER**.

### :unlock: Access GitLab

You can access GitLab from the `GitLab` icon on the Work Resources page.

Login with username `firstname.lastname` (the domain is not needed) and `password` .

   > :information_source: Our example user, Ada Lovelace would enter `ada.lovelace` in the `LDAP Username` box, enter her password and then click `Sign in` .

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/gitlab_screenshot_login.png" width="80%" title="gitlab_screenshot_login"/>
   </p>

  > :warning: Do not use your username and password from a pre-existing GitLab account.
  > The GitLab instance within the SRE is entirely separate from the https://gitlab.com service and is expecting the same username and password that you used to log into the SRE.

You can also access GitLab from an internet browser from the Linux Data cience Desktop by navigating to the same URL as when you access GitLab from the Work Resources page.

> :point_right: Accessing GitLab from the browser on the Linux Data Science Desktop is an easy way to switch between analysis work and documenting the process or results.
> You do not have to return to the "All Resources" tab ever time you want to launch GitLab (although you can do if that's easiest!)

+ Point Firefox to the url provided by the resource dashboard for GitLab/CodiMD.
+ If you have read and write access you will be able to copy the repository URL via the clipboard icon highlighted in the screenshot below:

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/gitlab_screenshot.png" width="80%" title="gitlab_screenshot"/>
   </p>

### :open_hands: Public repositories within the SRE

The GitLab instance inside the secure research environment is entirely contained *inside* the SRE.

When you make a repository inside the SRE "public" it is visible to your collaborators who also have access to the SRE.
A "public" repository within the SRE is only visible to others with the same data access approval, it is not open to the general public via the internet.

> :point_right: We recommend that you make your repositories public to facilitate collaboration within the secure research environment.

### :construction_worker: Support for GitLab use

If you have not used GitLab before:

+ There is a small tutorial available as an [Appendix](#-appendix-a-gitlab-tutorial-notes) to this user guide.
+ You can find the official documentation on the [GitLab website](<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/README.html>).
+ Ask your team mates for help.
+ Ask the designated contact for your SRE.
+ There may be a dedicated discussion channel, for example during Turing Data Study Groups you can ask in the Slack channel.

## :book: Collaborate on documents using CodiMD

CodiMD is a locally installed tool that allows you to collaboratively write reports.
It uses Markdown which is a simple way to format your text so that it renders nicely in full HTML.

> :earth_africa: CodiMD is a fully open source version of the HackMD software.
>
> This information doesn't matter at all for how you use CodiMD within the SRE, but we do want to thank the community for maintaining free and open source software for us to use and reuse.
> You can read more about CodiMD at [their GitHub repository](<https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd#codimd>).

We recommend this markdown cheat sheet by Adam Pritchard: [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>)

### :unlock: Access CodiMD

You can access CodiMD from the `CodiMD` icon on the Work Resources page.

Login with your long-form username `firstname.lastname@<username domain>` and `password`.

   > :information_source: Our example user, Ada Lovelace would enter `ada.lovelace@apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` in the `Username` box, enter her password and then click `Sign in` .

### :busts_in_silhouette: Editing other people's documents

The CodiMD instance inside the secure research environment is entirely contained *inside* the SRE.

When you make a markdown document inside the SRE "editable" your collaborators who also have access to the SRE can access it via the URL at the top of the page.
They will have the right to change the file if they are signed into the CodiMD instance.

The link will only work for people who have the same data access approval, it is not open to the general public via the internet.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/codimd_access_options.png" width="80%" title="codimd_logon"/>
   </p>

> :handshake: We recommend that you make your documents **editable** to facilitate collaboration within the secure research environment.
> Alternatively, the **locked** option allows others to read but not edit the document.

The default URL is quite long and difficult to share with your collaborators.
A **published** document has a shorter URL which is easier to share with others.

Click the `Publish` button to publish the document and generate the short URL.
Click the pen button (shown in the image below) to return to the editable markdown view.

   <p align="center">

> :pencil2: We recommend **publishing** the document to get a much shorter URL to share with your team.
>
> Remember that the document is not published to the internet, it is only available to others within the SRE.
>
> :point_right: If you are attending a Turing Data Study Group you will be asked to write a report describing the work your team undertook over the five days of the event.
> Store a copy of the CodiMD url in a text file in the outputs folder.
> You will find some example report templates that outline the recommended structure.
> We recommend writing the report in CodiMD - rather than GitLab - so that everyone can edit and contribute quickly.

### :microscope: Troubleshooting CodiMD

We have noticed that a lower case `L` and an upper case `I` look the same and often trip up users in the SRE.

> :point_right: Double check the characters in the URL, and if there are ambiguous ones try the one you haven't tried yet!

Rather than proliferate lots of documents, we recommend that one person is tasked with creating the file and sharing the URL with other team members.

> :point_right: You could use the GitLab wiki or `README` file to share links to collaboratively written documents.

## :unlock: Access additional virtual machines

Your project might make use of additional virtual machines apart from the main shared desktop.
Usually this is because of a requirement for a different type of computing resource, such as access to one or more GPUs (graphics processing units).

You will access this machine in a similar way to the main shared desktop, but by using the `DSVM Other (Desktop)` icon inside of the usual `DSVM Main (Desktop)` icon.
You will need to know the IP address of the new machine, which you will be told by the designated contact for your SRE.

+ When you click on the `DSVM Other (Desktop)` icon you will see a screen asking you to identify the computer you wish to connect to.
+ Enter the IP address of the additional virtual machine.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/dsvm_rdc_screen.png" width="80%" title="dsvm_rdc_screen"/>
   </p>

+ After entering the IP address, you will get the normal login screen, where you use the same `username` and `password` credentials as before.
+ Any local files that you have created in the `/output/` folder on other VMs (e.g. analysis scripts, notes, derived data) will be automatically available in the new VM.

## :green_book: Access databases

Your project might use a database for holding the input data.
You might also/instead be provided with a database for use in analysing the data.
The database server will use either `Microsoft SQL` or `PostgreSQL` .

If you have access to one or more databases, you can access them using the following details, where `<SRE ID>` is the first part of the URL you used to access the SRE (i.e. for an SRE accessed at `https://sandbox.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` , the `<SRE ID>` would be `sandbox` ).

### Microsoft SQL

> + Server name: `MSSQL-<SRE ID>` (e.g. `MSSQL-SANDBOX` )
> + Database name: \<provided by your SRE administrator>
> + Port: 1433

### PostgreSQL

> + Server name: `PSTGRS-<SRE ID>` (e.g. `PSTGRS-SANDBOX` )
> + Database name: \<provided by your SRE administrator>
> + Port: 5432

Examples are given below for connecting using Azure Data Studio, DBeaver, Python and R.
The instructions for using other graphical interfaces or programming languages will be similar.

### :art: Connecting using Azure Data Studio

Azure Data Studio is currently only able to connect to `Microsoft SQL` databases.

> :information_source: Our example user Ada Lovelace, working in the `sandbox` SRE on the `apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` Safe Haven, would connect using Azure Data Studio as follows:

   </p>

> :point_right: it is important to select `Windows authentication` here so that your username and password will be passed through to the database.

### :bear: Connecting using DBeaver

+ Click on the `New database connection` button (which looks a bit like an electrical plug with a plus sign next to it)

#### Microsoft SQL

+ Select `SQL Server` as the database type
+ Enter the necessary information in the `Host` and `Port` boxes and set `Authentication` to `Kerberos`
+ Tick `Show All Schemas` otherwise you will not be able to see the input data

   </p>

### :snake: Connecting using Python

Database connections can be made using `pyodbc` or `psycopg2` depending on which database flavour is being used.
The data can be read into a dataframe for local analysis.

> :information_source: Our example user Ada Lovelace, working in the `sandbox` SRE on the `apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` Safe Haven, would connect using DBeaver as follows:

port = "1433"
db_name = "master"

cnxn = pyodbc.connect("DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=" + server + "," + port + ";DATABASE=" + db_name + ";Trusted_Connection=yes;")

df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;", cnxn)
print(df.head(3))
```

#### PostgreSQL

``` python
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

server = "PSTGRS-SANDBOX.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk"
port = 5432
db_name = "postgres"

cnxn = psycopg2.connect(host=server, port=port, database=db_name)
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;", cnxn)
print(df.head(3))
```

### :registered: Connecting using R

Database connections can be made using `odbc` or `RPostgres` depending on which database flavour is being used.
The data can be read into a dataframe for local analysis.

> :information_source: Our example user Ada Lovelace, working in the `sandbox` SRE on the `apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` Safe Haven, would connect using DBeaver as follows:

## :bug: Report a bug

The Turing Safe Haven SRE has been developed in close collaboration with our users: you!

We try to make the user experience as smooth as possible and this document has been greatly improved by feedback from event participants and researchers going through the process for the first time.
We are constantly working to improve the SRE and we really appreciate your input and support as we develop the infrastructure.

> :point_right: If you find problems with the IT infrastructure, please contact the designated contact for your SRE.

### :wrench: Help us to help you

To help us fix your issues please do the following:

+ Make sure you have **read this document** and checked if it answers your query.
  + Please do not log an issue before you have read all of the sections in this document.

+ Log out and log back in again (whether this is to the Turing Safe Haven SRE or the Linux data science desktop) at least once.
  + Re-attempt the process leading to the bug/error at least twice.
  + We know that "turn it off and turn it back on again" is a frustrating piece of advice to receive, but in our experience it works rather well! (Particularly when there are lots of folks trying these steps at the same time.)
  + The multi-factor authentication step in particular is known to have quite a few gremlins.
  + If you are getting frustrated, log out of everything, turn off your computer, take a 15 minute coffee break, and then start the process from the beginning.

+ Write down a comprehensive summary of the issue.
  + A really good bug report makes it much easier to pin down what the problem is.

  Please include:
  + Your computer's operating system and operating system version.
  + Precise condition under which the error occurs.
    + What steps would someone need to take to get the exact same error?
  + A precise description of the problem.
    + What happens? What would you expect to happen if there were no error?
  + Any workarounds/fixes you have found.

> :bird: We very strongly recommend "rubber ducking" this process before you talk to the designated contact for your SRE.
>
> Either talk through to your imaginary rubber duck, or find a team member to describe the error to, as you write down the steps you have taken.
>
> It is amazing what saying the steps out loud can do to fix them.

+ Send the bug report to the designated contact for your SRE.

## :notebook: Appendix B: Gitlab tutorial notes

Gitlab can be thought of as a local version of github from different company - that is a git server along with useful features such as

+ Project wiki - exactly what it says
+ Project pastebin - share bits of code
+ Project issue tracker - track things TODO and bugs
+ Pull requests - Way to keep track of changes individuals have made to be included in master

Some teams design their entire workflows around these things.
A comparison in terms of features can be found [here](<https://usersnap.com/blog/gitlab-github/>).

### Getting started with Git

If you have never used Git before, you might want to take a look at an introductory guide.
There are multiple git cheat sheets such as [interactive](<http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html>) and [this one](<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet>).

### Repositories

A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.
We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.
Over the course of the work that you do in your SRE, you will often be accessing and adding files to the same project repository.

### Add your Git username and set your email

It is important to configure your Git username and email address, since every Git commit will use this information to identify you as the author.

On your shell, type the following command to add your username:

```bash
git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
```

Then verify that you have the correct username:

```bash
git config --global user.name
```

To set your email address, type the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"
```

To verify that you entered your email correctly, type:

```bash
git config --global user.email
```

You'll need to do this only once, since you are using the `--global` option. It tells Git to always use this information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different username or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the `--global` option when you’re in that project.

### Cloning projects

In Git, when you copy a project you say you "clone" it. To work on a git project locally (from your own computer), you will need to clone it. To do this, sign in to GitLab.

When you are on your Dashboard, click on the project that you’d like to clone. To work in the project, you can copy a link to the Git repository through a SSH or a HTTPS protocol. SSH is easier to use after it’s been set up, [you can find the details here](<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html>). While you are at the Project tab, select HTTPS or SSH from the dropdown menu and copy the link using the Copy URL to clipboard button (you’ll have to paste it on your shell in the next step>).

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/project_clone_url.png" width="80%" title="project_clone_url"/>
   </p>

Go to your computer’s shell and type the following command with your SSH or HTTPS URL:

```bash
git clone PASTE HTTPS OR SSH HERE
```

### Branches

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master` .

When you create a branch off the `master` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of `master` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

To create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

Work on an existing branch:

```bash
git checkout NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

To merge the master branch into a created branch you need to be on the created branch.

```bash
git checkout NAME-OF-BRANCH
git merge master
```

To merge a created branch into the master branch you need to be on the created branch.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

### Downloading the latest changes in a project

This is for you to work on an up-to-date copy (it is important to do this every time you start working on a project), while you set up tracking branches.
You pull from remote repositories to get all the changes made by users since the last time you cloned or pulled the project.
Later, you can push your local commits to the remote repositories.

```bash
git pull REMOTE NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

When you first clone a repository, REMOTE is typically "origin".
This is where the repository came from, and it indicates the SSH or HTTPS URL of the repository on the remote server.
NAME-OF-BRANCH is usually "master", but it may be any existing branch.

### Add and commit local changes

You’ll see your local changes in red when you type git status. These changes may be new, modified, or deleted files/folders.
Use git add to stage a local file/folder for committing.
Then use git commit to commit the staged files:

```bash
git add FILE OR FOLDER
git commit -m "COMMENT TO DESCRIBE THE INTENTION OF THE COMMIT"
```

To add and commit all local changes in one command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "COMMENT TO DESCRIBE THE INTENTION OF THE COMMIT"
```

To push all local commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push REMOTE NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

For example, to push your local commits to the master branch of the origin remote:

```bash
git push origin master
```

To delete all local changes in the repository that have not been added to the staging area, and leave unstaged files/folders, type:

```bash
git checkout .
```

__Note:__ The . character typically means all in Git.

### How to create a Merge Request

Merge requests are useful to integrate separate changes that you’ve made to a project, on different branches.
This is a brief guide on how to create a merge request.
For more information, check the [merge requests documentation](<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html>).

+ Before you start, you should have already created a branch and pushed your changes to GitLab.
+ Go to the project where you’d like to merge your changes and click on the Merge requests tab.
+ Click on New merge request on the right side of the screen.
+ From there on, you have the option to select the source branch and the target branch you’d like to compare to.

   The default target project is the upstream repository, but you can choose to compare across any of its forks.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/merge1.png" width="80%" title="merge1"/>
   </p>

+ When ready, click on the Compare branches and continue button.
+ At a minimum, add a title and a description to your merge request.

   Optionally, select a user to review your merge request and to accept or close it. You may also select a milestone and labels.

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/merge2.png" width="80%" title="merge2"/>
   </p>

+ When ready, click on the `Submit merge request` button.

Your merge request will be ready to be approved and merged.

## :microscope: Appendix C: Troubleshooting

### :exclamation: No applications available

#### Symptom

+ You can successfully log into the remote desktop web interface

> :information_source: For our example user, Ada Lovelace, this would be `https://sandbox.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` .

+ You do not see any available apps

   <p align="center">
      <img src="../../images/user_guide/no_folders_present.png" width="80%" title="no_folders_present">
   </p>

#### Cause

You have not yet set up your two factor authentication.

#### Solution

Follow the two factor authentication section from the [logging in section](#house-log-into-the-research-environment) of the user guide.

### :exclamation: Unexpected certificate error

#### Symptom

+ You can successfully log into the remote desktop web interface

> :information_source: For our example user, Ada Lovelace, this would be `https://sandbox.apr20.turingsafehaven.ac.uk` .

+ You can see several apps, but when you try to launch one of them, you receive an error saying "Your session ended because an unexpected server authentication certificate was received from the remote PC."
+ When you click on the padlock icon in the address bar and view the SSL certificate, the "SHA-1 Fingerprint" in the certificate matches the "SHA-1 Thumbprint" in the error message.

#### Cause

The SSL certificate protecting your connection to the RDS webclient expires every three months and is renewed every two months.
The new SSL certificate is seamlessly picked up by your browser when connecting to the web page.
However, the webclient downloads a separate copy of the certificate for its own use to validate connections to the apps it serves.
This downloaded certificate is cached by your browser, which means that the old certificate will continue to be used by the web app when the browser is allowed to load things from its cache.

#### Solution

Get your browser to do a [hard reload](<https://www.getfilecloud.com/blog/2015/03/tech-tip-how-to-do-hard-refresh-in-browsers/>) of the page (instructions vary by browser and operating system>).
You may also need to [clear your cache](<https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/>) for this site.
In either case, removing locally cached data should mean that you retrieve a copy of the new certificate.
