# How to guides

Our how-to guides are recipes that take you through the steps involved in deploying or managing an aspect of the Safe Haven.

They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some basic knowledge of how our Safe Havens work.

## How to be a sysadmin

+ [Safe Haven Administrator guide](administration/administrator_guide.md) - Instructions for administrators of a Safe Haven. Includes how to create and add new users to a Safe Haven environment and potential solutions for some common problems users may experience.

+ [Software package whitelist policy](software-package/software-package-whitelist-policy.md) - Guidance on our software package white listing policy.

## How to be a project manager

+ [Starting a project](project_management/starting-a-project.md) PLACEHOLDER. A guide for project managers to start new projects involving the Safe Haven

+ [Getting started with data classification](project_management/classification.md) - A guide for identifying the key stakeholders who must be involved in classifying the data before a project starts.

+ [Bringing data into the environment](project_management/data-ingress.md) - A guide to

for identifying the key stakeholders who must be involved in classifying the data before a project starts.

## How to be a data provider

+ [Data ingress guide for data providers](administration/how-to-ingress-data-as-provider.md) - Instructions for data providers, on how to transfer data into a safe haven for secure analysis.

+ [Data Classification User Guide](administration/how-to-use-classification-web-app-guide.md) - Step-by-step instructions for Data Providers, Investigators and Referees to classify project data using our web application. This application will guide you through our [classification process](../explanations/classification/Simple-Classification-Flow-Diagram.pdf) for determining the classification tier for a work package.

## How to be the principal investigator for a project

+ [Data Classification User Guide](administration/how-to-use-classification-web-app-guide.md) - Step-by-step instructions for Data Providers, Investigators and Referees to classify project data using our web application. This application will guide you through our [classification process](tiersflowchart.pdf) for determining the classification tier for a work package.

## How to be a research user on a project

Once an SRE has been set up for a project within a Safe Haven, users need to know how to access it in order to carry out their research.

+ [Safe Havens User Guide](user_guides/user-guide.md) - Step-by-step instructions on how to get set up on a Safe Haven environment as a user. The guide has been written with Turing Data Study Groups in mind.

+ [Software package whitelist policy](software-package/software-package-whitelist-policy.md) - Guidance on our software package white listing policy.
