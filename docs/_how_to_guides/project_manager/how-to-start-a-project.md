# Starting a project

This document details how project managers should set up a project that needs to use a Safe Haven.
The input data and the data analysis that will be carried out with it together form a work package.
Each work package needs to be classified in to one of five security tiers before any data sharing agreement can be signed.

## Pre-classification stages

Before we can classify the data itself, there are pre-classification stages to complete.

### Stakeholder identification

It is necessary to identify the **data owner** and make sure they have given permission to share the data with Turing.

If the organisation providing the data owns it then they are the data owner, but they may have purchased or loaned the data in which case they are not the data owner. Under these circumstances an additional step must be taken to ensure that the organisation providing the data have permission from the data owner to share it with Turing.

The **data controller** - an individual or sub-group of the organisation that owns the data - must be identified.

The person (or persons) at the organisation providing the data who will formally approve the data classification must be identified.

There will be additional people at the organisation that owns the data who should provide input in discussions around data sharing and data classification. This list of **data owner stakeholders** must be created and kept up to date.

Identify the **principal investigator**, who is in charge of the project from the research side.

Finally, you should identify a **referee**, who able to provide an independent evaluation of the work package.

### Review existing data governance arrangements

There may be existing agreements or arrangments that define the scope of data usage by Turing. These should be reviewed before assessing new plans.

### Consent and privacy of individuals in the dataset

If there is data relating to individual people in the data set, it is necessary to identify whether they have consented to their data being shared with others. An understanding of whether they need to be additionally contacted for permission to use the data is required, as is an assessment of any exclusions of informed consent for the purpose of research.

## Classification

The data classification process follows [this flow chart](../../explanations/classification/Full-Classification-Flow-Diagram.pdf). Step-by-step instructions on how to classify a work package using our web application [are given here](../general/how-to-use-classification-web-app-guide.md).
