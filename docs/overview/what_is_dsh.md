# What is the Data Safe Haven?

Secure environments for analysis of sensitive datasets are essential for research.
These environments are variously known as "data safe havens" or "trusted research environments" (TREs).

It is essential that sensitive or confidential datasets are kept secure.
This helps ensure that the analysis of such data complies with data protection laws.
It also forms part of the "social licence" to carry out these analyses ethically and for worthwhile reasons.

Creating and operating environments which are safe, efficient, productive and collaborative is a difficult task.
Decisions need to be made about the technical and policy requirements and how to enforce them.
