In this section we explain the decisions we have made about data flow in the Data Safe Haven.
We also detail the security stance of the different default tiered environments.

[Data access](data_access.md)
: How access to sensitive data is controlled in the Data Safe Haven.

[Data transfer](data_transfer.md)
: How sensitive data is transfered into and out of the Data Safe Haven.

[Security defaults](security_defaults.md)
: Default security controls for each secure research environment tier.
