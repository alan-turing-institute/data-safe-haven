- 1.6.2: There are technical controls that prevent information from being inappropriately copied or downloaded

  Any dataset that is rated as Tier 2 or above (which would include personal data that is not publicly available or commercially/politically/legally sensitive data) have technical controls in place to ensure data can’t be incorrectly removed from the DSH.
  These cover three main areas: + There are technical controls that ensures you can’t copy and paste between the environment and outside + You can’t connect to the internet from inside the environment + You can’t connect to Azure services (e.g Azure file storage) apart from the one which are secured inside the environment.

- 7.1.2: Do you have a business continuity plan in place to ensure continuity of services in event of data security incident, failure or compromise?

  Data security incident process:

  The DSH follows the Turing Institute’s data security incident process which can be found [here](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?origin=sspTile&unid=6c4590be2c74466497f5239915717621&from=7c877b26-e14b-400c-9097-ae99267258fe)..

  As an additional measure, when a potential data security incident was identified, the affected DSH would be shut down to ensure the security of the data. An investigation would be conducted simultaneously with the Data Security Team to identify any other potentially breached DSH’s and also shut these down.

- 7.2.1: Explain how your data security incident response and management plan has been tested to ensure all parties understand roles and responsibilities as part of the plan

  The DSH follows the Turing Institute’s data security incident process which can be found [here](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?origin=sspTile&unid=6c4590be2c74466497f5239915717621&from=7c877b26-e14b-400c-9097-ae99267258fe)..

- 7.3.4: Suitable backups are made, tested, documented and reviewed

  Data back-up policy:

  As the Data Safe Haven is not the canonical source of data a decision has been made to not back-up the data stored in the DSH.

  The data safe haven is a secure environment to store the data in, and the risk of needing to reimport the data is minimal. As any backup copy of the data would decrease the security of the data, a security decision has been taken that it is preferable to have to reimport the data from the original source in the event that it would need to be restored.

- 7.3.5: When did you last successfully restore from backup?

+ 8.1.1: What Software do you use?

  + Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release
  The DSVM will also come with the latest version of each of the below software packages (Note that the version is defined at build time, but any packages installed using apt are additionally updated to the latest version available at deploy time).
  It is easiest to update DSVMs by removing an existing VM and redeploying. The data, shared and home directories will be left untouched by this process.
  It is also possible to ingress updated software packages and update in place on a running DSVMs. This is only done in the case of essential security fixes where the project cannot afford the downtime involved in a redeploy.

- 8.2.2: The person with overall responsibility for data security confirms that the risk of unsupported systems is being managed

  There is currently no unsupported software allowed on the DSVM, a supported operating system and all updated software are installed as part of the build process for the VM.

- 8.3.1: How do your systems receive updates and how often?

  The DSVM will also come with the latest version of each of the below software packages (Note that the version is defined at build time, but any packages installed using apt are additionally updated to the latest version available at deploy time).
  It is easiest to update DSVMs by removing an existing VM and redeploying. The data, shared and home directories will be left untouched by this process.
  It is also possible to ingress updated software packages and update in place on a running DSVMs. This is only done in the case of essential security fixes where the project cannot afford the downtime involved in a redeploy.
