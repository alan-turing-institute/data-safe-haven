Deploying an instance of the Data Safe Haven involves the following steps:

- Configuring the context used to host the Pulumi backend infrastructure
- Configuring the Microsoft Entra directory where you will manage users
- Deploying the Safe Haven management component
- Deploying a Secure Research Environment for each project

## Requirements

Install the following requirements before starting

- [Python 3.12](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)

### Docker Hub

The Data Safe Haven uses several public Docker images.
As Docker Hub now imposes [rate limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) on anonymous downloads, you will need to use a Docker Hub account to deploy the Data Safe Haven.
You can create one following [the instructions here](https://hub.docker.com/) if you do not already have one.

:::{important}
We recommend using a personal access token (PAT) with **Public Repo Read-Only** permissions rather than your Docker account password.
See [the instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/) for details of how to create a PAT.
