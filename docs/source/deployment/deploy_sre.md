# Deploy a Secure Research Environment

These instructions will deploy a new Secure Research Environment (SRE).

::::{note}
As the Basic Application Gateway is still in preview, you will need to run the following commands once per subscription:

:::{code} shell
$ az feature register --name "AllowApplicationGatewayBasicSku" \
                      --namespace "Microsoft.Network" \
                      --subscription NAME_OR_ID_OF_YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION
$ az provider register --name Microsoft.Network
:::

::::

## Configuration

Each project will have its own dedicated SRE.

- Create a configuration file (optionally starting from one of our standard {ref}`policy_classification_sensitivity_tiers`)

::::{admonition} EITHER start from a blank template
:class: dropdown note

:::{code} shell
$ dsh config template --file PATH_YOU_WANT_TO_SAVE_YOUR_YAML_FILE_TO
:::
::::

::::{admonition} OR start from a predefined tier
:class: dropdown note

:::{code} shell
$ dsh config template --file PATH_YOU_WANT_TO_SAVE_YOUR_YAML_FILE_TO \
                      --tier TIER_YOU_WANT_TO_USE

::::{admonition} Example YAML configuration file
:class: dropdown tip

:::{code} yaml
azure:
  subscription_id: # ID of the Azure subscription that the TRE will be deployed to
  tenant_id: # Home tenant for the Azure account used to deploy infrastructure: `az account show`
description: # A free-text description of your SRE deployment
dockerhub:
  access_token: # The password or personal access token for your Docker Hub account. We strongly recommend using a Personal Access Token with permissions set to Public Repo Read-only
  username: # Your Docker Hub account name
name: # A name for your SRE deployment containing only letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores
sre:
  admin_email_address: # Email address shared by all administrators
  admin_ip_addresses: # List of IP addresses belonging to administrators
  data_provider_ip_addresses: # List of IP addresses belonging to data providers
  databases: # List of database systems to deploy
  remote_desktop:
    allow_copy: # True/False: whether to allow copying text out of the environment
    allow_paste: # True/False: whether to allow pasting text into the environment
  research_user_ip_addresses: # List of IP addresses belonging to users
  software_packages: # Which Python/R packages to allow users to install: [any/pre-approved/none]

:::{hint}
- See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/) for a full list of valid Azure VM SKUs
:::

:::{important}
All VM SKUs you want to deploy must support premium SSDs.

- SKUs that support premium SSD have a lower case 's' in their name.
- See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-naming-conventions) for a full naming convention explanation.
- See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds) for more details on premium SSD support.
:::

:::{important}
All VM SKUs you want to deploy must have CPUs with the `x86_64` architecture.

- SKUs with a lower case 'p' in their name have the ARM architecture and should not be used.
- See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-naming-conventions) for a full naming convention explanation.
:::

:::{important}
The antivirus process running on each workspace consumes around 1.3 GiB at idle.
This usage will roughly double for a short period each day while its database is updated.

You should take this into account when choosing a VM size and pick a SKU with enough memory overhead for your workload and the antivirus service.
:::

## Upload the configuration file

- Upload the config to Azure. This will validate your file and report any problems.

:::{code} shell
$ dsh config upload PATH_TO_YOUR_EDITED_YAML_FILE
:::

:::{hint}
If you want to make changes to the config, edit this file and then run `dsh config upload` again
:::

## Deployment

- Deploy each SRE individually [approx 30 minutes]:

:::{code} shell
$ dsh sre deploy YOUR_SRE_NAME
:::

::::{important}
After deployment, you may need to manually ensure that backups function.

- In the Azure Portal, navigate to the resource group for the SRE: **shm-_SHM\_NAME_-sre-_SRE\_NAME_-rg**
- Navigate to the backup vault for the SRE: **shm-_SHM\_NAME_-sre-_SRE\_NAME_-bv-backup**
- From the side menu, select **{menuselection}`Manage --> Backup Instances`**
- Change **Datasource type** to  **Azure Blobs (Azure Storage)**
- Select the **BlobBackupSensitiveData** instance

If you see the message **Fix protection error for the backup instance**, as pictured below, then click the **{guilabel}`Fix protection error`** button.
