# Using the Data Safe Haven

```{warning}
Use of a Data Safe Haven is not by itself sufficient to guarantee the security of your data! It must be paired with appropriate information governance requirements and user agreements.
```

```{warning}
Each organisation deploying their own instance of the Data Safe Haven is responsible for verifying their Data Safe Haven instance is deployed as expected and that the deployed configuration effectively supports their own information governance policies and processes.

Each organisation deploying their own instance of the Data Safe Haven is responsible for verifying that the instance is configured as expected. The organisation is also reponsible for confirming that the deployed configuration is appropriate for their purposes and effectively supports their own information governance policies and processes. We provide the Data Safe Haven code and material on an ‘as is’ basis without warranties of any kind and you use the code and supporting materials at your own cost and risk.
```

```{tip}
In terms of the [Five Safes framework](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/) the Data Safe Haven is aiming to be a Safe Setting.
