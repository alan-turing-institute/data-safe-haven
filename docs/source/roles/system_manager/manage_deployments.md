# Managing Data Safe Haven deployments

```{important}
This document assumes that you already have access to a {ref}`Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment <deploy_shm>` and one or more {ref}`Secure Research Environments (SREs) <deploy_sre>` that are linked to it.

(renew_ssl)=

## {{alarm_clock}} Renewing SRE Domain Certificates

The remote desktop frontend of an SRE will need to periodically have its SSL certificate renewed so that it can be accessed via HTTPS.
After each 90 day period that the SRE is live, re-run the script to update the certificate.

```powershell
PS> ./Update_SRE_SSL_Certificate.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -sreId <SRE ID>
```

- where `<SHM ID>` is the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` for this SHM

(resize_vm)=

## {{arrow_upper_right}} Resize the Virtual Machine (VM) of a Secure Research Desktop (SRD)

Sometimes during a project that uses a deployed SRE, researchers may find the available compute inadequate for their purposes and wish to increase the size of the SRD's VM. The **simplest way to resize a VM is via the Azure Portal**, but it can also be done via script.

To resize via the Azure Portal:

- Log into the Azure portal and locate the VM inside the Resource Group called `RG_SHM_<shm id>_SRE_<sre id>_COMPUTE`
- [Follow these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/resize-vm?tabs=portal) in the Azure portal

- Log into the Azure portal and locate the VM inside the Resource Group called `RG_SHM_<shm id>_SRE_<sre id>_COMPUTE`
- Make a note of the last octet of the IP address

```powershell
PS> ./Add_Single_SRD.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -sreId <SRE ID> -ipLastOctet <IP last octet> [-vmSize <VM size>] -Upgrade -Force
```

- where `<SHM ID>` is the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` for this SHM
- where `<SRE ID>` is the {ref}`secure research environment ID <roles_deployer_sre_id>` for this SRE
- where `<IP last octet>` is last octet of the IP address (check what this is in the Azure Portal)
- where `<VM size>` is the new [Azure VM size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes)
- where `<Upgrade>` is required to ensure the old VM is replaced
- where `<Force>` ensures that `<Upgrade>` works even when the VM is built with the same image

</details>

```{tip}
If the new `VM size` you want isn't shown as available in the Azure Portal, there are several steps that can be taken.

Firstly, try **stopping the VM** and checking again whether the size you want is available, as this can reveal additional options that aren't shown whilst the VM is running. For example, when resizing to an N-series VM in Azure, (see {ref}`using_gpus`) we've found that NVIDIA options such as the  NVv3-series are not always shown as available.

Next, you can try to **request an increase** in the vCPU quota for the VM family of the desired VM:
- Navigate to the Azure Portal and on the subscription page, click `Usage + quotas` under `Settings`
- Choose the family appropriate to the VM that you want to resize to, and select a region appropriate for the SRE
- Click the pen icon and set the `New Limit` to at least the number of vCPUs required by the VM that you want, the click submit
- After the request is accepted, resize the VM as above
- In some cases, the quota increase may require a request to be submitted to Microsoft
```

(add_new_srd)=

## {{heavy_plus_sign}} Add a new SRD

The `-VmSizes` parameter provided when deploying the SRE (with the `Deploy_SRE.ps1` script) determines how many SRDs are created and how large each one will be.

To deploy a new SRD into the SRE environment, follow the below instructions:

![Powershell: ten minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=ten%20minutes) at {{file_folder}} `./deployment/secure_research_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> ./Add_Single_SRD.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -sreId <SRE ID> -ipLastOctet <IP last octet> [-vmSize <VM size>]
```

- where `<SHM ID>` is the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` for this SHM
- where `<SRE ID>` is the {ref}`secure research environment ID <roles_deployer_sre_id>` for this SRE
- where `<IP last octet>` is last octet of the IP address (this must be different to any other SRD VMs)

(using_gpus)=

## {{minidisc}} Using GPUs in SRDs

When you {ref}`resize_vm` or {ref}`add_new_srd` featuring a GPU (N-series in Azure), you'll need to ensure it has an Nvidia GPU (as opposed to AMD or other).
See the [Azure docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu) for more information.
This is because only Nvidia GPUs support the drivers and CUDA libraries installed on the SRD image.

To test that a GPU enabled VM is working as expected, log into the SRE and type `nvidia-smi` into the terminal.

## {{crown}} Performing operations that require superuser privileges

If you need to perform any operations in the SRE that require root access, you will need to log into the `compute` VM via the Serial Console in the Azure Portal.

```{include} snippets/01_console.partial.md

```

## {{fire}} Remove a single SRE

In order to tear down an SRE, use the following procedure:

On your **deployment machine**.

- Ensure you have the same version of the Data Safe Haven repository as was used by your deployment team
- Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Data Safe Haven repository
- Ensure you are logged into `Azure` within `Powershell` using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`. This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code. You will need to visit that URL in a web browser and enter the code
- NB. If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
- Run the following script:

    ```powershell
    ./SRE_Teardown.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -sreId <SRE ID>
    ```

- If you provide the optional `-dryRun` parameter then the names of all affected resources will be printed, but nothing will be deleted

## {{end}} Remove a complete Safe Haven

### {{collision}} Tear down any attached SREs

On your **deployment machine**.

- Ensure you have the same version of the Data Safe Haven repository as was used by your deployment team
- Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Data Safe Haven repository
- Ensure you are logged into `Azure` within `Powershell` using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`. This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code. You will need to visit that URL in a web browser and enter the code

    ```{attention}
    If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
    ```

- For each SRE attached to the SHM, do the following:
    - Tear down the SRE by running:

    ```powershell
    ./SRE_Teardown.ps1 -sreId <SRE ID>
    ```

    where the SRE ID is the one specified in the relevant config file

    ```{note}
    If you provide the optional `-dryRun` parameter then the names of all affected resources will be printed, but nothing will be deleted
    ```

### {{unlock}} Disconnect from the Microsoft Entra ID

Connect to the **SHM Domain Controller (DC1)** via Remote Desktop Client over the SHM VPN connection

- Log in as a **domain** user (ie. `<admin username>@<SHM domain>`) using the username and password obtained from the Azure portal
- If you see a warning dialog that the certificate cannot be verified as root, accept this and continue
- Open Powershell as an administrator
    - Navigate to `C:\Installation`
    - Run `.\Disconnect_AD.ps1`
    - You will need to provide login credentials (including MFA if set up) for `<admin username>@<SHM domain>`

```{attention}
Full disconnection of the Microsoft Entra ID can take up to 72 hours but is typically less.
If you are planning to install a new SHM connected to the same Microsoft Entra ID you may find the `AzureADConnect` installation step requires you to wait for the previous disconnection to complete.
```

### {{bomb}} Tear down the SHM

On your **deployment machine**.

- Ensure you have the same version of the Data Safe Haven repository as was used by your deployment team
- Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Data Safe Haven repository
- Ensure you are logged into `Azure` within `Powershell` using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`. This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code. You will need to visit that URL in a web browser and enter the code

    ```{attention}
    If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
    ```

- Tear down the SHM by running:

    ```powershell
    ./SHM_Teardown.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID>
    ```

  where `<SHM ID>` is the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` specified in the configuration file.
