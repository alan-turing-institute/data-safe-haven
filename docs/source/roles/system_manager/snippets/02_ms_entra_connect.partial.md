````{note}
Microsoft Entra Connect is the new name for Azure AD Connect. However, although all Microsoft documentation and entries in the Azure portal now refer to Microsoft Entra Connect, as of this release of the Data Safe Haven, the software itself is still named `Azure AD Connect`. It will appear as such on your Domain Controller.
