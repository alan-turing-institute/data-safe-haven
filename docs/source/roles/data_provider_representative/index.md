The Dataset Provider is the organisation that provided the dataset under analysis.
The **Dataset Provider Representative** is the contact person chosen by that organisation to liaise with the institution hosting the Data Safe Haven.
They must be authorised to act on behalf of the Dataset Provider, especially when decisions need to be made about accessing the dataset.

There may be additional people at the Dataset Provider who will have input in discussions around data sharing and data classification.
It is the duty of the **Dataset Provider Representative** to manage this set of stakeholders at the Dataset Provider.
