# Dataset Provider Representative

```{toctree}
:hidden:
```

The Dataset Provider is the organisation that provided the dataset under analysis.
The **Dataset Provider Representative** is the contact person chosen by that organisation to liaise with the institution hosting the Data Safe Haven.
They must be authorised to act on behalf of the Dataset Provider, especially when decisions need to be made about accessing the dataset.

There may be additional people at the Dataset Provider who will have input in discussions around data sharing and data classification.
It is the duty of the **Dataset Provider Representative** to manage this set of stakeholders at the Dataset Provider.

## Information of interest to data providers

{ref}`Implementation details <design_architecture>`
: An overview of the design and implementation of the Data Safe Haven. Note that this architecture reflects that obtained when following our deployment guide in conjunction with the information governance processes at the Turing. However, each organisation is responsible for verifying the Data Safe Haven is deployed as expected and that the deployed configuration effectively supports their own information governance policies and processes.

{ref}`Security claims <design_security_claims>`
: Claims that we make about the security of the Data Safe Haven. Note that these claims relate only to the instance of the Data Safe Haven hosted by the Turing. The security claims for Data Safe Haven instances deployed by other organisations will depend on both how these organisations have configured their instance and their accompanying information governance policies and processes.

{ref}`Data classification guide <process_data_classification>`
: How we classify a work package into one of our security tiers at the Turing.
