# Data ingress process

When working with sensitive data it is important to take utmost care with it.
This will help you to ensure that the data integrity is maintained.

```{attention}
Ensure that you check what the expectations of your {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` are around data handling.
```

## Classification

The first stage of bringing input code and data into the Data Safe Haven is to classify them.
Make sure that you have followed the {ref}`same workflow <process_data_classification>` and agreed on the security tier with your {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` and {ref}`role_referee` (if applicable).

## Loading data into the environment

Once the classification is agreed, make sure that your {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` discusses the best way to bring your inputs into the environment with your {ref}`role_system_manager`.
