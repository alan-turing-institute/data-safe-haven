# Data egress process

Data Safe Havens are used for doing secure data research.
Once you have finished working with the data for your project, you'll have to conduct the egress of any outputs of your work before the environment is shutdown.

## Bringing data out of the environment

Once all parties have considered the sensitivity of outputs and agreed to release them, make sure that your {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` discusses the best way to extract your outputs from the environment with your {ref}`role_system_manager`.

```{note}
You might want to define multiple data collections for egress, which would each have their own sensitivity.
For example, you might separate a low-sensitivity written report from a high-sensitivity derived dataset.
The egress process can then be adjusted based on the sensitivity of each dataset.
For example, the low-sensitivity report can be publically released whereas the high-sensitivity derived dataset may go back to the data provider only.
