As the research project lead, this individual is responsible for ensuring that project staff comply with the Environment's security policies.
Multiple collaborating institutions may have their own lead staff members, and staff members might delegate responsibilities for the SRE to other researchers.
However, each project must have a single lead **Investigator** who takes responsibility for it.

```{warning}
The **Investigator** must be able and willing to accept responsibility for the conduct of the project and its members.
