# Migrating an SHM

This document assumes that you have already deployed a [Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment](../../tutorial/deployment_tutorials/how-to-deploy-shm.md) and one or more [Secure Research Environments (SRE)](../../tutorial/deployment_tutorials/how-to-deploy-sre.md) that are linked to it.

It will help you update the SHM to a newer release by deploying a new SHM and migrating the users to it.

![Powershell: estimate of time needed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=estimate%20of%20time%20needed)

+ This indicates a `Powershell` command which you will need to run locally on your machine
+ Ensure you have checked out the appropriate version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).
+ Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the indicated directory of your locally checked-out version of the Safe Haven repository
+ Ensure that you are logged into Azure by running the `Connect-AzAccount` command
  + :pencil: If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
+ This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code.
  + You will need to visit that URL in a web browser, enter the code and log in to your account on Azure
  + :pencil: If you have several Azure accounts, make sure you use one that has permissions to make changes to the subscription you are using

![Remote: estimate of time needed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-onedrive&label=remote&color=blue&message=estimate%20of%20time%20needed)

+ This indicates a command which you will need to run remotely on an Azure virtual machine (VM) using `Microsoft Remote Desktop`
+ Open `Microsoft Remote Desktop` and click `Add Desktop` / `Add PC`
+ Enter the private IP address of the VM that you need to connect to in the `PC name` field (this can be found by looking in the Azure portal)
+ Enter the name of the VM (for example `DC1-SHM-TESTA`) in the `Friendly name` field
+ Click `Add`
+ Ensure you are connected to the SHM VPN that you have set up
+ Double click on the desktop that appears under `Saved Desktops` or `PCs`.
+ Use the `username` and `password` specified by the appropriate section of the guide
+ :pencil: If you see a warning dialog that the certificate cannot be verified as root, accept this and continue.

![Portal: estimate of time needed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-azure&label=portal&color=blue&message=estimate%20of%20time%20needed)

+ This indicates an operation which needs to be carried out in the [`Azure Portal`](https://portal.azure.com) using a web browser on your local machine.
+ You will need to login to the portal using an account with privileges to make the necessary changes to the resources you are altering

![Azure AD: estimate of time needed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-academic&label=Azure%20AD&color=blue&message=estimate%20of%20time%20needed)

+ This indicates an operation which needs to be carried out in the [`Azure Portal`](https://portal.azure.com) using a web browser on your local machine.
+ You will need to login to the portal using an account with administrative privileges on the `Azure Active Directory` that you are altering.
+ Note that this might be different from the account which is able to create/alter resources in the Azure subscription where you are building the Safe Haven.

:pencil: **Notes**

+ This indicates some explanatory notes or examples that provide additional context for the current step.

:warning: **Troubleshooting**

+ This indicates a set of troubleshooting instructions to help diagnose and fix common problems with the current step.

## :seedling: 1. Prerequisites

+ All of the [Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment](../../tutorial/deployment_tutorials/how-to-deploy-shm.md#seedling-1-prerequisites) prerequisites

The following variables will be used during deploying

+ `<old SHM ID>`: the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for the previously deployed SHM
+ `<SHM ID>`: the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for the new SHM you want to deploy
+ `<AAD tenant ID>`: the `Tenant ID` for the Azure Active Directory that your previously deployed SHM is connected to

## :unlock: 2. Disconnect the old domain controller from the Azure Active Directory

![Remote: one minute](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-onedrive&label=remote&color=blue&message=one%20minute)

+ Log into the **SHM primary domain controller** for the old SHM (`DC1-SHM-<old SHM ID>`) VM using the `private IP address`, `<admin login>` and `<admin password>` from the portal
+ Open Powershell as an administrator
  + Navigate to `C:\Installation`
  + Run `.\Disconnect_AD.ps1`
  + You will need to provide login credentials (including MFA if set up) for `<admin username>@<SHM domain>`

+ :warning: Do not attempt to add users to the old SHM after this point as they will not be synchronised to the Azure Active Directory!

### :pencil: Notes

+ Full disconnection of the Azure Active Directory can take up to 72 hours but will typically take around one day

## :clipboard: 3. Safe Haven Management configuration

+ Create a copy of the configuration file for your previous SHM
+ You may want to change some of the following attributes:

```json
{
    "azure": {
        "subscriptionName": "Azure subscription to deploy the SHM into. You might want to use a different subscription than for your previous SHM.",
    },
    "shmId": "The <SHM ID> for the new SHM. If you try to deploy two SHMs with the same ID into the same subscription some resources will not deploy correctly.",
}
