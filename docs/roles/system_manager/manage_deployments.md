# Managing Data Safe Haven deployments

```{important}
This document assumes that you already have access a {ref}`Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment <deploy_shm>` and one or more {ref}`Secure Research Environments (SREs) <deploy_sre>` that are linked to it.
```

## {{fire}} Remove a single SRE

In order to tear down an SRE, use the following procedure:

On your **deployment machine**.

- Ensure you have the same version of the Data Safe Haven repository as was used by your deployment team
- Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Data Safe Haven repository
- Ensure you are logged into `Azure` within `Powershell` using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`. This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code. You will need to visit that URL in a web browser and enter the code
- NB. If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
- Run the following script:

  ```powershell
  ./SRE_Teardown.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -sreId <SRE ID>
  ```

- If you provide the optional `-dryRun` parameter then the names of all affected resources will be printed, but nothing will be deleted

## {{end}} Remove a complete Safe Haven

### {{collision}} Tear down any attached SREs

On your **deployment machine**.

- Ensure you have the same version of the Data Safe Haven repository as was used by your deployment team
- Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Data Safe Haven repository
- Ensure you are logged into `Azure` within `Powershell` using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`. This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code. You will need to visit that URL in a web browser and enter the code

  ```{attention}
  If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
  ```

- For each SRE attached to the SHM, do the following:
  - Tear down the SRE by running:

    ```powershell
    ./SRE_Teardown.ps1 -sreId <SRE ID>
    ```

    where the SRE ID is the one specified in the relevant config file

    ```{note}
    If you provide the optional `-dryRun` parameter then the names of all affected resources will be printed, but nothing will be deleted
    ```

### {{unlock}} Disconnect from the Azure Active Directory

Connect to the **SHM Domain Controller (DC1)** via Remote Desktop Client over the SHM VPN connection

- Log in as a **domain** user (ie. `<admin username>@<SHM domain>`) using the username and password obtained from the Azure portal
- If you see a warning dialog that the certificate cannot be verified as root, accept this and continue
- Open Powershell as an administrator
  - Navigate to `C:\Installation`
  - Run `.\Disconnect_AD.ps1`
  - You will need to provide login credentials (including MFA if set up) for `<admin username>@<SHM domain>`

```{attention}
Full disconnection of the Azure Active Directory can take up to 72 hours but is typically less.
If you are planning to install a new SHM connected to the same Azure Active Directory you may find the `AzureADConnect` installation step requires you to wait for the previous disconnection to complete.
```

### {{bomb}} Tear down the SHM

On your **deployment machine**.

- Ensure you have the same version of the Data Safe Haven repository as was used by your deployment team
- Open a `Powershell` terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Data Safe Haven repository
- Ensure you are logged into `Azure` within `Powershell` using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`. This command will give you a URL and a short alphanumeric code. You will need to visit that URL in a web browser and enter the code

  ```{attention}
  If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
  ```

- Tear down the SHM by running:

  ```powershell
  ./SHM_Teardown.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID>
  ```

  where `<SHM ID>` is the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` specified in the configuration file.
