## 2. {{clipboard}} Secure Research Environment configuration

The full configuration details for a new SRE are generated by defining a few "core" properties for the new SRE and the management environment in which it will be deployed.

### Secure research environment ID

Choose a short ID `<SRE ID>` to identify the secure research environment (e.g. `sandbox`).
This can have a **maximum of seven alphanumeric characters**.

### {{apple}} SHM configuration properties

The core properties for the relevant pre-existing Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment must be defined in a JSON file named `shm_<SHM ID>_core_config.json` in the `environment_configs` folder.
Please {ref}`read the instructions <roles_system_deployer_shm_configuration_file>` to find out what to put in this file.

### {{green_apple}} SRE configuration properties

The core properties for the secure research environment (SRE) must be defined in a JSON file named `sre_<SHM ID><SRE ID>_core_config.json` in the `environment_configs` folder.
The following core SRE properties are required - look in the `environment_configs` folder to see some examples.

```json
{
  "sreId": "The <SRE ID> that you decided on above (eg. 'sandbox').",
  "tier": "The data classification tier for the SRE. This controls the outbound network restrictions on the SRE and which mirror set the SRE is peered with",
  "nexus": "[Optional, Bool] Whether to use a Nexus repository as a proxy to PyPI and CRAN. Defaults to true if tier is 2 and false otherwise.",
  "shmId": "The <SHM ID> that you decided on above (eg. 'testa').",
  "subscriptionName": "Azure subscription that the SRE will be deployed into.",
  "ipPrefix": "The three octet IP address prefix for the Class A range used by the management environment. See below for suggestion on how to set this",
  "inboundAccessFrom": "A comma-separated string of IP ranges (addresses or CIDR ranges) from which access to the RDS webclient is permitted. See below for suggestion on how to set this.",
  "outboundInternetAccess": "Whether to allow outbound internet access from inside the remote desktop environment. Either ('Yes', 'Allow', 'Permit'), ('No', 'Deny', 'Forbid') or 'default' (for Tier 0 and 1 'Allow' otherwise 'Deny')",
  "computeVmImage": {
    "type": "The name of the Compute VM image (most commonly 'Ubuntu')",
    "version": "The version of the Compute VM image (e.g. 0.1.2019082900)"
  },
  "remoteDesktopProvider": "Which remote desktop provider to use. Either 'ApacheGuacamole' (recommended, tiers 0-3) or 'MicrosoftRDS' (tiers 2-3 only)",
  "dataAdminIpAddresses": "[Optional] A list of one or more IP addresses which admins will be using to transfer sensitive data to/from the secure Azure storage area (if not specified then Turing IP addresses will be used).",
  "deploymentIpAddresses": "[Optional] A list of one or more IP addresses which admins will be using when deploying the SRE (if not specified then deployment commands from any IP address will be permitted).",
  "azureAdminGroupName": "[Optional] Azure Security Group that admins of this SRE will belong to. If not specified then the same one as the SHM will be used.",
  "domain": "[Optional] The fully qualified domain name for the SRE. If not specified then <SRE ID>.<SHM domain> will be used.",
  "databases": "[Optional] A list of one or more database flavours from the following list ('MSSQL', 'PostgreSQL'). For example ['MSSQL', 'PostgreSQL'] would deploy both an MS-SQL and a PostgreSQL database.",
  "overrides": "[Optional, Advanced] Do not use this unless you know what you're doing! If you want to override any of the default settings, you can do so by creating the same JSON structure that would be found in the final config file and nesting it under this entry. For example, to change the name of the Key Vault secret containing the MSSQL admin password, you could use something like: 'sre: { databases: { dbmssql: { adminPasswordSecretName: my-password-name } } }'"
}
```

```{tip}
We recommend the following for the `inboundAccessFrom` setting
- Tier 0/1 SREs: this can be set to `Internet`, allowing access from anywhere.
- Tier 2 SREs: this should correspond to the **organisational networks** (including guest networks) for all approved partner organisations (i.e. any network managed by the organisation, such as `EduRoam`, `Turing Guest`, `Turing Secure`)
- Tier 3 SREs: this should correspond to the **restricted networks** for all approved partner organisations. These should only permit connections from within medium security access controlled physical spaces and from managed devices (e.g. `Turing Secure`).
```

```{admonition} Alan Turing Institute default
Setting `inboundAccessFrom` to 'default' will use the default Turing network ranges.
```

```{important}
The `ipPrefix` must be unique for each SRE attached to the same SHM.
It is **very** important that address spaces do not overlap in the environment as this will cause network faults.
```

```{admonition} Alan Turing Institute default
Assign each SRE a `/21` subspace of the `10.0.0.0/24` private class A range, starting from `10.21.0.0`.
This provides ample addresses for a SRE while avoiding the space already occupied by the SHM `10.0.1.0 - 10.0.7.255` and the mirrors (`10.20.2.0-10.20.3.255`)
```

### (Optional) Verify code version

If you have cloned/forked the code from our `GitHub` repository, you can confirm which version of the Data Safe Haven you are currently using by running the following commands:

![Powershell: a few seconds](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20seconds)

```powershell
PS> git tag --list | Select-String $(git describe --tags)
```

This will check the tag you are using against the list of known tags and print it out.
You can include this confirmation in any record you keep of your deployment.

### (Optional) {{full_moon}} View full SRE configuration

A full configuration, which will be used in subsequent steps, will be automatically generated from your core configuration.
Should you wish to, you can print the full SRE config by running the following Powershell command:

![Powershell: a few seconds](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20seconds) at {{file_folder}} `./deployment`

```powershell
PS> ./ShowConfigFile.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -sreId <SRE ID>
```

- where `<SHM ID>` is the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` for this SHM
- where `<SRE ID>` is the {ref}`secure research environment ID <roles_deployer_sre_id>`for this SRE
