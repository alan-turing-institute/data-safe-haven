# Migrating an SHM

These instructions will walk you through migrating an existing Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment to a newer **Data Safe Haven** release and migrating the users to it.

```{note}
This document assumes that you have already deployed a {ref}`Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment <deploy_shm>` and one or more {ref}`Secure Research Environments (SREs) <deploy_sre>` that are linked to it.
```

```{danger}
This is a complex operation and may not always work. You may lose data or user accounts in the migration process.
```

## 1. {{seedling}} Prerequisites

- All of the {ref}`Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment <deploy_shm_prerequisites>` prerequisites

The following variables will be used during deploying

- `<old SHM ID>`: the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` for the previously deployed SHM
- `<SHM ID>`: the {ref}`management environment ID <roles_deployer_shm_id>` for the new SHM you want to deploy
- `<AAD tenant ID>`: the {ref}`Tenant ID <roles_deployer_aad_tenant_id>` for the `Azure Active Directory` that your previously deployed SHM is connected to

## 2. {{unlock}} Disconnect the old domain controller from the Azure Active Directory

![Remote: one minute](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-onedrive&label=remote&color=blue&message=one%20minute)

- Log into the **SHM primary domain controller** for the old SHM (`DC1-SHM-<old SHM ID>`) VM using the `private IP address`, `<admin login>` and `<admin password>` from the portal
- Open `Powershell` as an administrator

  - Navigate to `C:\Installation`
  - Run `.\Disconnect_AD.ps1`
  - You will need to provide login credentials (including MFA if set up) for `<admin username>@<SHM domain>`

```{warning}
Do not attempt to add users to the old SHM after this point as they will not be synchronised to the `Azure` Active Directory!
```

```{attention}
Full disconnection of the `Azure` Active Directory can take up to 72 hours but will typically take around one day.
```

## 3. {{clipboard}} Safe Haven Management configuration

- Create a copy of the configuration file for your previous SHM
- You may want to change some of the following attributes:

```json
{
  "azure": {
    "subscriptionName": "Azure subscription to deploy the SHM into. You might want to use a different subscription than for your previous SHM."
  },
  "shmId": "The <SHM ID> for the new SHM. If you try to deploy two SHMs with the same ID into the same subscription some resources will not deploy correctly."
}
```

## 4. {{door}} Configure DNS for the custom domain

### {{anchor}} Reset Azure AD source anchors

![Remote: ten minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-onedrive&label=remote&color=blue&message=ten%20minutes)

- Log into the **SHM primary domain controller** (`DC1-SHM-<SHM ID>`) VM that you have just deployed using the `private IP address`, `<admin login>` and `<admin password>` that you obtained from the portal

Run the following `Powershell` commands

```powershell
# Get local users
$userOuPath = (Get-ADObject -Filter * | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Safe Haven Research Users" }).DistinguishedName
$users = Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "$userOuPath" -Properties *

# Connect to AzureAD
# Use the credentials for an AzureAD global admin (eg. `aad.admin.firstname.surname@<SHM domain>`)
Connect-MsolService

# Reset source anchor for AzureAD users
foreach ($user in $users) {
  $immutableId = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($user.ObjectGUID.ToByteArray())
  Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $($user.UserPrincipalName) -immutableID $immutableId
  Write-Output "Set source anchor for $($user.UserPrincipalName) to $immutableId"

```

### {{train}} Install Azure Active Directory Connect

````{error}
Since you are trying to connect the new SHM to an `Azure` Active Directory that was already synchronised, you may find the `AzureADConnect` installation fails due to a `Directory synchronisation failure`.

```{image} migrate_shm/aad_connection_failure.png
:alt: AAD connection failure

If this happens then you will need to wait for the previous disconnection to complete, which may take up to 72 hours.
