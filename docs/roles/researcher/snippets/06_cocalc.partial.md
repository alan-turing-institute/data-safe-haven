## {{couple}} Collaborate on code using CoCalc

`CoCalc` is a collaborative calculation and data science environment.
It lets you work with others on projects, using `Jupyter`, `LaTeX`, `Octave`, `Python` or `R` in collaborative notebooks.

The `CoCalc` instance within the SRE is the easiest way to work directly with others in your team (for example pair-programming) who might not be physically near you.
You do not need to worry about the security of the information you upload there as it is fully contained within the SRE and there is no access to the internet and / or external servers.

```{important}
The `CoCalc` instance within the SRE is entirely separate from the https://cocalc.com service.
```

### {{unlock}} Access CoCalc

You can access `CoCalc` from an internet browser in the Linux Data Science Desktop using the desktop shortcut.
The first time that you login, you will see a security warning.
This is expected, please click on `Advanced` and then `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

You will then get to the CoCalc homepage where you should click on `Sign In`

You will need to create a new account.
You can use any username/password here - it is not connected to your main Safe Haven account.
