For security reasons, you must reset your password before you log in for the first time.
Please follow these steps carefully.

- Open a private/incognito browser session on your computer.

  ```{tip}
  One of the most common problems that users have in connecting to the SRE is automatic completion of usernames and passwords from other accounts on their computer.
  This can be quite confusing, particularly for anyone who logs into Microsoft services for work or personal use.
  ```

  ```{caution}
  Look out for usernames or passwords that are automatically completed, and make sure that you're using the correct details needed to access the SRE.
  ```

- Navigate to the following URL in your browser: `https://aka.ms/mfasetup` .
  This short link starts the process of logging into your account.

- At the login prompt enter `username@<username domain>` and confirm/proceed.
  Remember that your username will probably be in the format `firstname.lastname` .

  ```{note}
  Our example user, Ada Lovelace, participating in the `sandbox` project at a Turing Data Study Group, would enter `ada.lovelace@projects.turingsafehaven.ac.uk`
  ```

- There will then be a password prompt.

  The first time you log in you need to click **"Forgotten my password"**.

  ```

  ```{caution}
  If you reset your password, you will need to wait 5-10 mins before logging in again, to allow the user management system to sync up with the new password.
  ```

- Fill out the requested CAPTCHA (your username should be pre-filled).

<!-- WARNING: If replace this image, make sure you do so at docs/deployment/user_guide too -->

- Confirm your phone number, which you provided to the {ref}`System Manager <role_system_manager>` when you registered for access to the environment.

  ```

- Select a password.

  Your password must comply with the following requirements:

  ```{important}
  - alphanumeric
  - minimum 12 characters
  - at least one each of:
    - {{input_latin_uppercase}} uppercase character
    - {{input_latin_lowercase}} lowercase character
    - {{input_numbers}} number
  - you should choose a unique password for the SRE to ensure it is secure
  ```

  ```{caution}
  Do not use special characters or symbols in your password!
  The virtual keyboard inside the SRE may not be the same as your physical keyboard and this can make it difficult to type some symbols.
  ```

  Note that this will also ensure that it passes the [Microsoft Azure AD password requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy).

  ```{tip}
  We recommend using a password generator [like this one](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/) to create a password that meets these requirements.
  This will ensure that the password is different from any others that you might use and that it is unlikely to be on any list of commonly used passwords.
  ```

  If your password is too difficult to memorise, we recommend using a password manager, for example [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), to store it securely.

- Enter your password into the `Enter new password` and `Confirm new password` fields.

### {{door}} Set up multi-factor authentication

The next step in setting up your account is to authenticate your account from your phone.
This additional security verification is to make it harder for people to impersonate you and connect to the environment without permission.
This is known as multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### {{telephone_receiver}} Phone number registration

- In order to set up MFA you will need to enter your phone number

#### Troubleshooting MFA

Sometimes setting up MFA can be problematic.
You may find the following tips helpful:

- {{inbox_tray}} Make sure you allow notifications on your authenticator app.
- {{sleeping}} Check you don't have _Do not Disturb_ mode on.
- {{zap}} You have to be SUPER FAST at acknowledging the notification on your app, since the access codes update every 30 seconds.
- {{confused}} Sometimes just going through the steps again solves the problem
