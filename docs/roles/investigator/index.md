The research project lead, this individual is responsible for ensuring that project staff comply with the Environment's security policies.
A single lead **Investigator** must be responsible for a project.
Multiple collaborating institutions may have their own lead academic staff, and academic staff might delegate to a researcher the leadership as far as interaction with the SRE is concerned.
In both cases, the term **Investigator** here is independent of this - regardless of academic status or institutional collaboration, this individual accepts responsibility for the conduct of the project and its members.
