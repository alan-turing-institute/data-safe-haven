# Requesting new software packages

In the course of your work you might find you want to use particular software packages or tools that are not preinstalled in the environment.

## CRAN/PyPI packages

When working in a tier 3 environment, only a subset of packages are available in the Data Safe Haven package mirrors.
In order to request the inclusion of a new package on this list, do the following:

- Complete the {ref}`software package request form <software_package_request_form>`.
- Send this to your {ref}`role_system_manager` for review according to the terms of the {ref}`approval policy <policy_security_package_approval>`.
- The {ref}`role_system_manager` should then send this to the {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` for their approval.
- If approved, the {ref}`role_system_manager` will add the package to the appropriate tier 3 package allowlist.

## Other software

For other software, a similar workflow applies:

- Complete the {ref}`software package request form <software_package_request_form>`.
- Send this to your {ref}`role_system_manager` for review according to the terms of the {ref}`approval policy <policy_security_package_approval>`.
- The {ref}`role_system_manager` should then send this to the {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` for their approval.
- If approved, the {ref}`role_system_manager` will install the software in the project's SRE.
