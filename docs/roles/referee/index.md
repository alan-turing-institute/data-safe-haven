# Referee

A **Referee** volunteers to review code or derived data (data which is computed from the original dataset), providing evidence to the {ref}`role_investigator` and {ref}`role_data_provider_representative` that the researchers are complying with data handling practices.
**Referees** also play a role in classifying work packages at tier 2 or above, when they should be consulted by either the {ref}`role_investigator` or the {ref}`role_data_provider_representative`.
