# Safe Haven - Egressing Data

Data Safe Havens are used for doing secure data research on a single 'work package' of data. Once you're done working with the data for your project, you'll have to egress all of the work you've been doing from the environment, before shutting it down.

Each time you egress data from the environment, you'll have to classify the data you're taking out, as a new work package on our classification tool, so you know how to handle it correctly. At the Turing, we recommend that make two separate data egress work packages upon completing a project.

## Egress Work package 1 - Reports and outputs for report finalisation 

When you're finishing a project, you'll need to complete reports and any other outputs that might be pertinent to the presentation of the research you've done. In this workpackage, you'll be egressing the documents, graphs, pictures and any other data you might need to make it easier to finish the report.

If there are images or details within these outputs that might constitute a tier of 2 or above, these should be removed temporarily for the purposes of the report writing process, to allow you to work outside of the secure environment. A separate discussion should be had between the lead investigator and the data provider representative as to how such items can be suitably redacted so that they can be included in the final document. If the report itself is classified as Tier 2, it will need to be completed and presented within a secure environment.

**Datasets:** Report inputs including text, images and code snippets.

## Egress Work package 1 - Data Provider Handover

In this work package, you'll need to include all other outputs, including derived data sets and full code to be returned to the Data Provider for archiving. If this returns a high tier then a conversation needs to take place about where it should be stored, and whether some outputs should be redacted prior to release.

**Datasets:** All outputs, including text, images, code and any derived datasets.
