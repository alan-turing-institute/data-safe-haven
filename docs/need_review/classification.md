# Data classification process

This document details the process through which the data is classified in to one of five [data tiers](<https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/wiki/DataTiers>).

Note that this step should be part of the data sharing agreement process managed by a Turing Business Development Manager or Project Manager. **Turing should not sign a data sharing agreement without knowing what classification it has been assigned.**

## Pre-classification stages

Before we can classify the data itself, there are pre-classification stages to complete.

### Stakeholder identification

It is necessary to identify the **data owner** and make sure they have given permission to share the data with Turing.

If the organisation providing the data owns it then they are the data owner, but they may have purchased or loaned the data in which case they are not the data owner. Under these circumstances an additional step must be taken to ensure that the organisation providing the data have permission from the data owner to share it with Turing.

The **data controller** - an individual or sub-group of the organisation that owns the data - must be identified.

The person (or persons) at the organisation providing the data who will formally approve the data classification must be identified.

There will be additional people at the organisation that owns the data who should provide input in discussions around data sharing and data classification. This list of **data owner stakeholders** must be created and kept up to date.

Identify the **principal investigator**, who is in charge of the project from the research side.

Finally a list of people at the Turing who should provide input into discussions around data sharing and data classification. This list of

> QUESTION: WHO AT TURING:
> + Who needs to have input? Researcher, PM/BDM, REG?
> + Who at Turing needs to formally approve? Head of Security and IT?

### Review existing data governance arrangements

There may be existing agreements or arrangments that define the scope of data usage by Turing. These should be reviewed before assessing new plans.

### Consent and privacy of individuals in the dataset

If there is data relating to individual people in the data set, it is necessary to identify whether they have consented to their data being shared with others. An understanding of whether they need to be additionally contacted for permission to use the data is required, as is an assessment of any exclusions of informed consent for the purpose of research.
