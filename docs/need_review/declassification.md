The project member triggers the declassification process in a form within the management framework, specifying the path to the declassification script.

The project member should then explain, in the form, their reasons for believing that the script does indeed produce data of the appropriate tier; and describes the structure of the data in sufficient detail to allow the referee to understand the action of the script. (The referee may not be authorised to access the data.)
