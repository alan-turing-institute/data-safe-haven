# What is a Safe Haven?

Secure Environments for analysis of sensitive datasets are essential for research. Such "data safe havens" are a vital part of the research infrastructure.

It is essential that sensitive or confidential datasets are kept secure, both to enable analysis of personal data in a manner that is capable of being compliant with data protection law, and to avoid jeopardising the consent of society for research activities with personal data (called 'social license').

To create and operate these Environments safely and efficiently whilst ensuring usability, requires, as with many sociotechnical systems, a complex stack of interacting business process and design choices. This document describes the approaches taken by the Alan Turing Institute when building and managing Environments for productive, secure, collaborative research projects.

We propose choices for the security controls that should be applied in the areas of:

+ data classification
+ data ingress (data entering a secure Environment from an external source)
+ data egress (data leaving a secure Environment to an external recipient)
+ software ingress (software entering a secure Environment from an external source)
+ user access
+ user device management
+ analysis Environments

We do this for each of a small set of security "Tiers" - noting that the choice of security controls depends on the sensitivity of the data.
