# Safe Haven Management Environment Build Instructions

These instructions will deploy a new Safe Haven Management Environment (SHM). This is required to manage your Secure Research Environments (SREs) and **must be** deployed before you create any SREs. A single SHM can manage all your SREs. Alternatively, you may run multiple SHMs concurrently, for example you may have a group of projects with the same lifecycle which share a different SHM to your other projects.

## :clipboard: 2. Safe Haven Management configuration

### Management environment ID

Choose a short ID `<SHM ID>` to identify the management environment (e.g. `testa`). This can have a **maximum of seven alphanumeric characters**.

### Create configuration file

The core properties for the Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment must be defined in a JSON file named `shm_<SHM ID>_core_config.json` in the `environment_configs/core` folder.
The following core SHM properties are required - look at `shm_testa_core_config.json` to see an example.

```json
{
    "name": "Name of this Safe Haven (eg. 'Turing Production Safe Haven').",
    "shmId": "The <SHM ID> that you decided on above (eg. 'testa').",
    "domain": "The fully qualified domain name for the management environment (eg. 'testa.dsgroupdev.co.uk')",
    "timezone": "[Optional] Timezone in IANA format (eg. 'Europe/London').",
    "azure": {
        "subscriptionName": "Azure subscription to deploy the management environment into.",
        "adminGroupName" : "Azure Security Group that admins of this Safe Haven will belong to.",
        "location": "Azure location to deploy the management environment into (eg. 'uksouth')."
     },
     "organisation": {
        "name": "Name of your organisation, used when generating SSL certificates (eg. 'The Alan Turing Institute')",
        "townCity": "Town where your organisation is located, used when generating SSL certificates (eg. 'London')",
        "stateCountyRegion": "Region where your organisation is located, used when generating SSL certificates (eg. 'London')",
        "countryCode": "Country where your organisation is located, used when generating SSL certificates (eg. 'GB')",
        "contactEmail": "Email address at your organisation that will receive notifications when SSL certificates are about to expire."
    },
    "dnsRecords": {
        "subscriptionName": "[Optional] Azure subscription which holds DNS records (if not specified then the value from the 'azure' block will be used).",
        "resourceGroupName": "[Optional] Resource group which holds DNS records (eg. RG_SHM_DNS_TEST)."
    },
    "vmImages": {
        "subscriptionName": "[Optional] Azure subscription where VM images will be built (if not specified then the value from the 'azure' block will be used). Multiple Safe Haven deployments can share a single set of VM images in a common subscription if desired - this is what is done in the Turing deployment. If you are hoping to use images that have already been built for another Safe Haven deployment, make sure you specify this parameter accordingly.",
        "location": "[Optional] Azure location where VM images should be built (if not specified then the value from the 'azure' block will be used). Multiple Safe Haven deployments can share a single set of VM images in a common subscription if desired - this is what is done in the Turing deployment. If you are hoping to use images that have already been built for another Safe Haven deployment, make sure you specify this parameter accordingly.",
        "buildIpAddresses": "[Optional] One or more IP addresses which admins will be running the VM build scripts from (if not specified then Turing IP addresses will be used)."
     },
    "overrides": "[Optional, Advanced] Do not use this unless you know what you're doing! If you want to override any of the default settings, you can do so by creating the same JSON structure that would be found in the final config file and nesting it under this entry. For example, to change the size of the data disk on the domain controller, you could use something like: 'shm: { dc: { disks: { data: { sizeGb: 50 } } } }'"
}
```

#### :pencil: Notes

+ This configuration file is also used when deploying an SRE environment.
+ :maple_leaf: We recommend that you set the fully qualified domain name to `<SHM ID>.<some domain that you control>`.
  + This may require purchasing a dedicated domain so follow your organisation's guidance.
  + ![Alan Turing Institute](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alan%20Turing%20Institute-555?&logo=canonical&logoColor=white) **production** uses `<SHM ID>.turingsafehaven.ac.uk`
  + ![Alan Turing Institute](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alan%20Turing%20Institute-555?&logo=canonical&logoColor=white) **development** uses `<SHM ID>.dsgroupdev.co.uk`

### (Optional) Verify code version

If you have cloned/forked the code from our GitHub repository, you can confirm which version of the data safe haven you are currently using by running the following commands:

![Powershell: a few seconds](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20seconds)

```powershell
PS> git fetch; git pull; git status; git log -1 --pretty="At commit %h (%H)"
```

This will verify that you are on the correct branch and up to date with `origin`. You can include this confirmation in any record you keep of your deployment.

### (Optional) View full SHM configuration

A full configuration, which will be used in subsequent steps, will be automatically generated from your core configuration. Should you wish to, you can print the full SHM config by running the following Powershell command:

![Powershell: a few seconds](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20seconds) at :file_folder: `./deployment`

```powershell
PS> ./ShowConfigFile.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID>
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM

## :door: 3. Configure DNS for the custom domain

![Powershell: a few minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20minutes) at :file_folder: `./deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> ./Setup_SHM_DNS_Zone.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID>
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM

### :warning: Troubleshooting

If you see a message `You need to add the following NS records to the parent DNS system for...` you will need to add the NS records manually to the parent's DNS system, as follows:

<details><summary><b>Manual DNS configuration instructions</b></summary>

+ To find the required values for the NS records on the portal, click `All resources` in the far left panel, search for `DNS Zone` and locate the DNS Zone with the SHM's domain. The NS record will list four Azure name servers.
+ Duplicate these records to the parent DNS system as follows:
  + If the parent domain has an Azure DNS Zone, create an NS record set in this zone. The name should be set to the subdomain (e.g. `testa`) or `@` if using a custom domain, and the values duplicated from above
    + For example, for a new subdomain `testa.dsgroupdev.co.uk`, duplicate the NS records from the Azure DNS Zone `testa.dsgroupdev.co.uk` to the Azure DNS Zone for `dsgroupdev.co.uk`, by creating a record set with name `testa`
  ![Subdomain NS record](../../images/deploy_sre/subdomain_ns_record.png)
  + If the parent domain is outside of Azure, create NS records in the registrar for the new domain with the same value as the NS records in the new Azure DNS Zone for the domain.

</details>

## :file_folder: 4. Setup Azure Active Directory (AAD)

### Create a new Azure Active Directory

![Portal: one minute](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-azure&label=portal&color=blue&message=one%20minute)

+ From the Azure portal, click `Create a Resource` and search for `Azure Active Directory`
  <details><summary><b>Screenshots</b></summary>

+ Click `Create`
+ Set the `Organisation Name` to the value of `<name>` in your core configuration file (e.g. `Turing Development Safe Haven A`)
  + Note: be careful not to confuse this with the `<name>` under `<organisation>` used in the config file
+ Set the `Initial Domain Name` to the `Organisation Name` all lower case with spaces removed (e.g. `turingdevelopmentsafehavena`)
+ Set the `Country or Region` to whatever region is appropriate for your deployment (e.g. `United Kingdom`)
  <details><summary><b>Screenshots</b></summary>

### Add the SHM domain to the Azure Active Directory

![Powershell: a few minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20minutes) at :file_folder: `./deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> pwsh { ./Setup_SHM_AAD_Domain.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -tenantId <AAD tenant ID> }
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM
+ where `<AAD tenant ID>` is the `Tenant ID` that you copied from the AAD above

#### :pencil: Notes

Note the bracketing `pwsh { ... }` which runs this command in a new Powershell environment. This is necessary in order to prevent conflicts between the `AzureAD` and `Az` Powershell modules.

#### :warning: Troubleshooting

+ If you get an error like `Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, Version=3.19.8.16603, Culture=neutral PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'. Could not find or load a specific file. (0x80131621)` then you may need to try again in a fresh Powershell terminal.
+ Due to delays with DNS propagation, the script may occasionally exhaust the maximum number of retries without managing to verify the domain. If this occurs, run the script again. If it exhausts the number of retries a second time, wait an hour and try again.
+ ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/-555?&logo=windows&logoColor=white) If you get an error that the `Connect-AzureAD` command is unavailable, you may need to manually import the correct cross platform module by running `Import-Module AzureAD.Standard.Preview`.

## :key: 5. Deploy Key Vault for SHM secrets and create emergency admin account

![Powershell: ten minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=ten%20minutes) at :file_folder: `./deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> pwsh { ./Setup_SHM_Key_Vault_And_Emergency_Admin.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -tenantId <AAD tenant ID> }
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM
+ where `<AAD tenant ID>` is the `Tenant ID` that you copied from the AAD above

### :pencil: Notes

Note the bracketing `pwsh { ... }` which runs this command in a new Powershell environment. This is necessary in order to prevent conflicts between the `AzureAD` and `Az` Powershell modules.

### :warning: Troubleshooting

If you get an error like `Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, Version=3.19.8.16603, Culture=neutral PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'. Could not find or load a specific file. (0x80131621)` then you may need to try again in a fresh Powershell terminal.

### Configure emergency admin account

The User who creates the AAD will automatically have a **guest** account created in the AAD, with the Global Administrator (GA) Role. Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure Active Directory). You will use this account for almost all administration of the Safe Haven Azure AD.

However, there are rare operations that require you to be logged in as a **native** Global Administrator. For example, purchasing non-trial MFA licences.

To support these rare cases, and to allow access to the Safe Haven Azure AD in the case of loss of access to personal administrator accounts (e.g. lost access to MFA), an **emergency access** administrator account has been created by the above script. However, this account must be manually assigned to the Global Administrator role.

![Azure AD: one minute](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-academic&label=Azure%20AD&color=blue&message=one%20minute)

+ From the Azure portal, navigate to the AAD you have created.
+ Click `Users` in the left hand sidebar and click on the `AAD Admin - EMERGENCY ACCESS` user.
+ Add the `Global Administrator` role to the user.
  + Click `Assigned roles` in the left hand menu
  + Click `Add assignments` in the top menu above the (empty) list of roles
  + Search for `Global Administrator`
  + Check `Global Administrator`
  + Click the `Add` button

## :iphone: 6. Enable MFA and self-service password reset

To enable MFA and self-service password reset, you must have sufficient licences for all users.

### Add licences that support MFA

![Azure AD: a few minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-academic&label=Azure%20AD&color=blue&message=a%20few%20minutes)

Click the heading that applies to you to expand the instructions for that scenario.

<details><summary><b>Test deployments</b></summary>

**For testing** you can enable a free trial of the P2 License (NB. It can take a while for these to appear on your AAD). You can activate the trial while logged in as your deafult guest administrator account.

+ From the Azure portal, navigate to the AAD you have created.
+ Click on `Licences` in the left hand sidebar

## :id: 7. Configure internal administrator accounts

The emergency access admin account should not be used except in a genuine emergency. In particular, it should not be used as a shared admin account for routine administration of the Safe Haven.

A default external administrator account was automatically created for the user you were logged in as when you initially created the Azure AD. This user should also not be used for administering the Azure AD, as it is not controlled by this AD. You will delete this user after creating a new **native** administrator account for yourself and the other administrators of the Safe Haven.

:maple_leaf: In order to avoid being a single point of failure, we strongly recommend that you add other administrators in addition to yourself.

### Add internal administrator accounts for yourself and others

Several later steps will require the use of a **native** administrator account with a valid mobile phone and email address. You must therefore create and activate a **native** administrator account for each person who will be acting as a system administrator.

:maple_leaf: We strongly recommend that you delete the default external administrator account after creating the native account

#### Create a new account for each administrator (including yourself)

![Azure AD: a few minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-academic&label=Azure%20AD&color=blue&message=a%20few%20minutes)

+ From the Azure portal, navigate to the AAD you have created.
+ Click `Users` in the left hand sidebar and click on the `+New user` icon in the top menu above the list of users.
+ Create an internal admin user:
  + User name: `aad.admin.firstname.lastname@<SHM domain>`
  + Name: `AAD Admin - Firstname Lastname`
  + Leave `Auto-generate password` set. Users will be able to reset their passwords on first login and it is good security practice for admins not to know user passwords.
  + Click the `User` link in the `Roles` field and make the user an administrator:

    + On the `AD forest account` pop-up:
      + Select `Use existing AD account`
      + Enter the details for the `localadsync` user.
        + **Username**: use the value of the `shm-<SHM ID>-aad-localsync-username` secret in the SHM key vault:
          + EITHER prepended with `<Domain ID>\`, where the `Domain ID` is the capitalised form of the `<SHM ID>`, so if the *SHM ID* is `testa` and the *username* is `testalocaladsync` then you would use `TESTA\testalocaladsync` here.
          + OR suffixed with `<SHM domain>`, so if the *SHM domain* is `testa.dsgroupdev.co.uk` and the *username* is `testalocaladsync` then you would use `testalocaladsync@testa.dsgroupdev.co.uk` here.
        + **Password**: use the `shm-<SHM ID>-aad-localsync-password` secret in the SHM key vault.

#### :pencil: Notes

Take care to consider any differences in the keyboard of your machine and the Windows remote desktop when entering any usernames or passwords

#### :warning: Troubleshooting

+ If you receive an Internet Explorer pop-up dialog `Content within this application coming from the website below is being blocked by Internet Explorer Advanced Security Configuration` for Microsoft domains such as `https://login.microsoft.com` or `https://aadcdn.msftauth.net` then you can safely add these as exceptions:
  + Click `Add`
  + Click `Close`
+ If you receive an error message on the login webpage pop-ups saying `We can't sign you in. Javascript is required to sign you in....` followed by the Script Error: `Do you want to continue running scripts on this page` you can safely allow Javascript:
  + Click `Yes`
  + Close the dialog by clicking `X`
+ If you see a Windows Security Warning, related to the MFA login:
  + Check `Don't show this message again`
  + Click `Yes` to close the dialog.
+ If you get an error that the username/password is incorrect or that the domain/directory could not be found when entering the details for the `localadsync` user, try resetting the password for this user in the **Domain Controller** Active Directory so that it matches the value stored in the Key Vault
  + In Server Manager click `Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers`
  + Expand the domain in the left hand panel
  + Expand the `Safe Haven Service Accounts` OU
  + Right click on the `<SHM ID> Local AD Sync Administrator` user and select `reset password`
  + Set the password to the value from the appropriate Key Vault secret.
  + Leave the other settings alone and click `OK`
+ The error `Directory synchronization is currently in a pending disabled state for this directory. Please wait until directory synchronization has been fully disabled before trying again` may occur if you have recently torn down another SHM linked to the same Azure Active Directory. You need to wait for the Azure Active Directory to fully disconnect - this can take up to 72 hours but is typically sooner. You do not need to close the installer window while waiting. If you need to, you can disconnect from the DC and VPN and reconnect later before clicking `Retry`.

#### Update Azure Active Directory Connect rules

This step allows the locale (country code) to be pushed from the local AD to the Azure Active Directory.

![Remote: one minute](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-onedrive&label=remote&color=blue&message=one%20minute)

+ Log into the **SHM primary domain controller** (`DC1-SHM-<SHM ID>`) VM using the `private IP address`, `<admin login>` and `<admin password>` that you obtained from the portal above
+ Run the following command on the remote domain controller VM to update the AAD rules

```powershell
PS> C:\Installation\UpdateAADSyncRule.ps1
```

### Validate Active Directory synchronisation
This step validates that your local Active Directory users are correctly synchronised to Azure Active Directory. Note that you can use the same script after deploying an SRE to add users in bulk.

![Remote: one minute](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-onedrive&label=remote&color=blue&message=one%20minute)

+ Log into the **SHM primary domain controller** (`DC1-SHM-<SHM ID>`) VM using the `private IP address`, `<admin login>` and `<admin password>` that you obtained from the portal above
+ Generating user CSV file
  + Make a new copy of the user details template file from `C:\Installation\user_details_template.csv` on the SHM DC1 domain controller.
  We suggest naming this `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_user_details.csv` but this is up to you
  + Add your details to create a researcher account for yourself.
    + `SamAccountName`: Log in username **without** the @domain bit. Use `firstname.lastname` format and please stick to unnaccented lower case ascii letters with a period separating the name parts. Maximum length is 20 characters.
    + `GivenName`: User's first / given name
    + `Surname`: User's last name / surname
    + `Mobile`: Phone number to use for initial password reset.
      This must include country code in the format `+<country-code> <local number>` (e.g. `+44 7700900000`).
      Include a space between the country code and local number parts but no other spaces.
      Remove the leading `0` from local number if present.
      This can be a landline or or mobile but must be accessible to the user when resetting their password and setting up MFA.
      They can add the authenticator app and / or another phone number during MFA setup and at least one MFA method must work when at the Turing.
    + `SecondaryEmail`: An existing organisational email address for the user.
      Not uploaded to their Safe Haven user account but needs to be added here so we reliably send the account activation
    + [Optional] `GroupName`: SRE group that the user will be added to. As these groups are created during the SRE deployment you can leave this empty for this initial validation of the synchronisation process.

+ Run the following command on the remote domain controller VM to create and synchronise the users

```powershell
PS> C:\Installation\CreateUsers.ps1 <path_to_user_details_file>
```

+ This script will add the users and trigger a sync with Azure Active Directory
+ Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate

![Azure AD: a few seconds](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-academic&label=Azure%20AD&color=blue&message=a%20few%20seconds)

+ Click `Users > All users` and confirm that the new user is shown in the user list.
+ The new user account should have the `Directory synced` field set to `Yes`

#### :warning: Troubleshooting
If you get the message `New-ADUser:  The specified account already exists` you should first check to see whether that user actually does already exist! Once you're certain that you're adding a new user, make sure that the following fields are unique across all users in the Active Directory.

+ `SamAccountName`: Specified explicitly in the CSV file. If this is already in use, consider something like `firstname.middle.initials.lastname`
+ `DistinguishedName`: Formed of `CN=<DisplayName>,<OUPath>` by Active directory on user creation. If this is in use, consider changing `DisplayName` from `<GivenName> <Surname>` to `<GivenName> <Middle> <Initials> <Surname>`.

### Configure AAD side of AD connect

    + You should see `Azure Active Directory Premium P1` in the list of products, with a non-zero number of available licenses.
    + If you do not have P1 licences, purchase some following the instructions at the end of the [Add additional administrators](#Add-additional-administrators) section above, making sure to also follow the final step to configure the MFA settings on the Azure Active Directory.
    + If you are using the trial `Azure Active Directory Premium P2` licences, you may find that enabling a trial of `Enterprise Mobility + Security E5` licences will resolve this.
  + Make sure that you have added a P1 licence to at least one user in the `Azure Active Directory` and have gone through the MFA setup procedure for that user. You may have to wait a few minutes after doing this
  + If you've done all of these things and nothing is working, you may have accidentally removed the `Azure Multi-Factor Auth Client` Enterprise Application from your `Azure Active Directory`. Run `C:\Installation\Ensure_MFA_SP_AAD.ps1` to create a new service principal and try the previous steps again.

  + Make sure you are logged in to the NPS server as a **domain** user rather than a local user.
    + The output of the `whoami` command in Powershell should be `<SHM netBios domain>\<SHM admin>` rather than `NPS-SHM-<SHM ID>\<SHM admin>`.
    + If it is not, reconnect to the remote desktop with the username `admin@<SHM domain>`, using the same password as before
  + Make sure you authenticate to `Azure Active Directory` your own **native** Global Administrator (i.e. `admin.firstname.lastname@<SHM domain>`) and that you have successfully logged in and verified your phone number + email address and configured MFA on your account.

## :closed_lock_with_key: 11. Require MFA for all users

:exclamation: Before completing this step, **make sure you have confirmed you are able to successfully log in as the emergency access admin**, as this account will be the only one excluded from the MFA requirement

## :package: 12. Deploy Python/R package repositories
We currently support two different types of package repositories:

+ Nexus proxy (Tier-2 only)
+ Local mirror (Tier-2 and/or Tier-3)

Each SRE can be configured to connect to either the local mirror or the Nexus proxy as desired - you will simply have to ensure that you have deployed whichever repository you prefer before deploying the SRE.

### How to deploy a Nexus package repository

We **recommend** deploying this for use with tier-2 SREs

![Powershell: ten minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=ten%20minutes) at :file_folder: `./deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> ./Setup_SHM_Nexus.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -tier <desired tier>
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM
+ where `<desired tier>` is either `2` or `3`

### How to deploy a local package mirror

We **recommend** deploying this for use with tier-3 SREs

![Powershell: thirty minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=thirty%20minutes) at :file_folder: `./deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> ./Setup_SHM_Package_Mirrors.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID> -tier <desired tier>
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM
+ where `<desired tier>` is either `2` or `3`

#### :pencil: Notes

:exclamation: Note that a full set of local Tier 2 mirrors currently take around **two weeks** to fully synchronise with the external package repositories as PyPI now contains >10TB of packages.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: 13. Deploy logging

![Powershell: a few minutes](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=powershell&label=local&color=blue&message=a%20few%20minutes) at :file_folder: `./deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/setup`

```powershell
PS> ./Setup_SHM_Logging.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID>
```

+ where `<SHM ID>` is the [management environment ID](#management-environment-id) for this SHM

### :warning: Troubleshooting
The API call that installs the logging extensions to the VMs times out after a few minutes, so you may get some extension installation failure messages. If so, try re-running the logging set up script. In most cases the extensions have actually been successfully installed.

## :fire_engine: 14. Deploy firewall
<!-- NB. this could be moved earlier in the deployment process once this has been tested, but the first attempt will just focus on locking down an already-deployed environment -->
