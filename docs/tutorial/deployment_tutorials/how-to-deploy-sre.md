# Secure Research Environment Build Instructions

These instructions will walk you through deploying a Secure Research Environment (SRE) that uses an existing Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment.

We currently support two different remote desktop solutions:

+ :pear: **Apache Guacamole** (:sparkles: recommended :sparkles:)
  + [All tiers](how-to-deploy-sre-apache-guacamole.md)
+ :bento: **Microsoft Remote Desktop**
  + [Tiers 0/1](how-to-deploy-sre-cocalc.md) which use `CoCalc` as the user interface
  + [Tiers 2/3](how-to-deploy-sre-microsoft-rds.md) which use `Microsoft Remote Desktop` as the user interface
