## :seedling: Prerequisites
This document assumes that you have already deployed a [Safe Haven Management (SHM) environment](deploy_shm_instructions.md) and one or more [Secure Research Environments (SRE)](deploy_sre_instructions.md) that are linked to it.

- You will need VPN access to the SHM as described in the deployment instructions


# :beginner: Creating new users

Users should be created on the main domain controller (DC1) in the SHM and synchronised to Azure Active Directory.
A helper script for doing this is already uploaded to the domain controller - you will need to prepare a CSV file in the appropriate format for it.

## :scroll: Generating CSV file using data classification app
- Follow the [instructions in the webapp repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven-webapp/blob/master/runbooks/create-users/create-users.md) to create users.
  - Users can be created in bulk by selecting `Create User > Import user list` and uploading a spreadsheet of user details
  - Users can also be created individually by selecting `Create User > Create Single User`
- After creating users, export the `UserCreate.csv` file
  - To export all users, select `Users > Export UserCreate.csv`
  - To export only users for a particular project, select `Projects > (Project Name) > Export UserCreate.csv`

## :scroll: Generating CSV file manually
- Make a new copy of the user details template file from `deployment/safe_haven_management_environment/user_details.csv`
  - :pencil: we suggest naming this `YYYYDDMM-HHMM_user_details.csv` but this is up to you
- Add the required details for each user
  - `SamAccountName`: Log in username **without** the @domain bit. Use `firstname.lastname` format. Maximum length is 20 characters.
  - `GivenName`: User's first / given name
  - `Surname`: User's last name / surname
  - `Mobile`: Phone number to use for initial password reset.
    This must include country code in the format `+<country-code> <local number>`.
    Include a space between the country code and local number parts but no other spaces.
    Remove the leading `0` from local number if present.
    This can be a landline or or mobile but must be accessible to the user when resetting their password and setting up MFA.
    They can add the authenticator app and / or another phone number during MFA setup and at least one MFA method must work when at the Turing.
  - `SecondaryEmail`: An existing organisational email address for the user.
    Not uploaded to their Safe Haven user account but needs to be added here so we reliably send the account activation

## :fast_forward: Optional: Add group name
If you know which groups each user will be added to, you can also include the following column:
  - `GroupName`: The name of the Azure security group(s) that the users should be added (eg. `SG SANDBOX Research Users`).
    If the user needs to be added to multiple groups, separate them with a pipe-character (`|`).

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Create and synchronise users
Upload the user details CSV file to a sensible location on the SHM domain controller (eg. `C:\Installation`).
On the **SHM domain controller (DC1)**.
- Open a PowerShell command window with elevated privileges.
- Run `C:\Installation\CreateUsers.ps1 <path_to_user_details_file>`
- This script will add the users and trigger a sync with Azure Active Directory, but it will still take around 5 minutes for the changes to propagate.

### :microscope: Troubleshooting: Account already exists
If you get the message `New-ADUser :  The specified account already exists` you should first check to see whether that user actually does already exist!
Once you're certain that you're adding a new user, make sure that the following fields are unique across all users in the Active Directory.
- `SamAccountName`: Specified explicitly in the CSV file. If this is already in use, consider something like `firstname.middle.initials.lastname`
- `DistinguishedName`: Formed of `CN=<DisplayName>,<OUPath>` by Active directory on user creation. If this is in use, consider changing `DisplayName` from `<GivenName> <Surname>` to `<GivenName> <Middle> <Initials> <Surname>`.

## :calling: Assign an MFA licence
### Manually add licence to users
- Login into the Azure Portal and connect to the correct AAD
- Open `Azure Active Directory`
- Select `Manage > Licenses > All Products`
- Click `Azure Active Directory Premium P1`
- Click `Assign`
- Click `Users and groups`
- Select the users you have recently created and click `Select`
- Click `Assign` to complete the process

### Automatic
To automatically assign licences to all local AD users that do not currently have a licence in AAD

- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).
- Open a Powershell terminal and navigate to the `deployment/administration` directory within the Safe Haven repository.
- Run the `./SHM_Add_AAD_Licences.ps1 -shmId <SHM ID>` script, where the SHM ID is the ID of the SHM you wish to add licences for.


## :running: User activation
We need to contact the users to tell them their user ID and.
We can securely email users their user ID as they do not know their account password and they need access to the phone number they provided in order to reset this.
We should also send them a copy of the [Safe Haven User Guide](safe_haven_user_guide.md) at this point.

A sample email might look like the following

> Dear \<participant name\>,
>
> Welcome to \<event name\>! You've been given access to a data Safe Haven running on Turing infrastructure.
> Please find a PDF version of our user guide attached.
> You should start by following the instructions about setting up your account and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).
>
> Your username is: \<username@domain\>
> Your Safe Haven is hosted at: \<URL\>
>
> The Safe Haven is only accessible from certain networks and may also involve physical location restrictions.
>
> --details about network and location/VPN restrictions here--



## :construction_worker: Common user problems

One of the most common user issues is that they are unable to log in to the environment.
Here we go through the login procedure and discuss possible problems at each step

### :waning_crescent_moon: Expired webclient certificate
If the certificate for the SRE domain has expired, users will not be able to login.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/administrator_guide/login_certificate_expiry.png" width="80%" title="login_certificate_expiry">
</p>

**Solution**:
Replace the SSL certificate with a new one
- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).
- Open a Powershell terminal and navigate to the `deployment/secure_research_environment/setup` directory within the Safe Haven repository.
- Ensure you are logged into the Azure within PowerShell using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`
- Run `./Update_SRE_RDS_Ssl_Certificate.ps1 -sreId <SRE ID>`, where the SRE ID is the one specified in the config.


### :red_circle: Unable to log into remote desktop gateway
If users give the wrong username or password they will not be able to progress past the login screen.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/administrator_guide/login_password_login.png" width="80%" title="login_password_login">
</p>

**Solution**:
Check user credentials, password may need to be reset.


### :train: Unable to open any remote apps
Users are stuck at the `Opening remote port` message and never receive the MFA prompt.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/administrator_guide/login_shared_vm.png" width="80%" title="login_shared_vm">
</p>

**Solution**:
- Ensure that the user has been assigned a license in Azure Active Directory
- Check that the user has set up MFA (at `aka.ms/mfasetup`) and is using the phone-call or app authentication method


### :interrobang: xrdp login failure on the DSVM
If users can get to the login screen:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/administrator_guide/login_compute_vm_login.png" width="80%" title="Shared VM login screen">
</p>

but then see this error message:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/administrator_guide/login_compute_vm_login_failure.png" width="80%" title="Login failure message">
</p>

there are a couple of possible causes.

**Problem**: the username or password was incorrectly entered
**Solution**
- Confirm that the username and password have been correctly typed
- Confirm that there are no unsupported special characters in the password
- Reset the account if there is no other solution

**Problem**: the computer is unable to communicate with the login server
**Solution**
- This can happen for a variety of reasons (DNS problems, broken services on the compute VM etc.)
- Run the script under `deployment/administration/SRE_DSVM_Remote_Diagnostics.ps1`, providing the group and last IP octet of the problematic compute VM
- You should see output like the following:

```
PS /home/atiadmin/data-safe-haven/deployment/administration> ./SRE_DSVM_Remote_Diagnostics.ps1 -sreId 2 -ipLastOctet 160

### :cloud: Unable to install from package mirrors
If it is not possible to install packages from the package mirrors then this may be for one of the following reasons:

**Problem**: Mirror VNet is not correctly peered
**Solution**
Re-run the network configuration script.
On your **deployment machine**.
- Ensure you have the latest version of the Safe Haven repository from [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven).
- Open a Powershell terminal and navigate to the `deployment/secure_research_environment/setup` directory within the Safe Haven repository.
- Ensure you are logged into Azure within PowerShell using the command: `Connect-AzAccount`
  - NB. If your account is a guest in additional Azure tenants, you may need to add the `-Tenant <Tenant ID>` flag, where `<Tenant ID>` is the ID of the Azure tenant you want to deploy into.
- Run the `./Apply_Network_Configuration.ps1 -sreId <SRE ID>` script, where the SRE ID is the one specified in the config


**Problem**: Internal mirror does not have the required package
**Solution**
To diagnose this, log into the `Internal` mirror using the Serial Console through the `Azure` portal.
Check the packages directory (i.e. `/datadrive/mirrordaemon/pypi/web/packages` for PyPI or `/datadrive/mirrordaemon/www/cran` for CRAN)

<p align="center">

</p>

If the requested is expected to be available (i.e. it is on the appropriate whitelist), then you can force a mirror update by rebooting the `EXTERNAL` mirrors.
This will trigger the following actions:

1. Synchronisation of the external mirror with the remote, internet repository (a `pull` update)
2. Synchronisation of the internal mirror with the external mirror (a `push` update)

This may take an hour or two but should solve the missing package problem.
