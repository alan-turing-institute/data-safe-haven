Many of the important questions we want to answer for society require the use of sensitive data.
In order to effectively answer these questions, we need productive, secure environments to analyse that data.

We have developed:

- A proposal for how to design productive and secure research environments.
- A shared model for classifying projects into common sensitivity tiers, with a web-based tool to support this process.
- A proposed default set of technical security measures for each tier.
- A set of infrastructure-as-code tools which will allow anyone to deploy their own isolated research environment.
