Many of the important questions we want to answer for society require the use of sensitive data.
In order to effectively answer these questions, we need productive, secure environments to analyse the data.

We have developed:

- A shared model for classifying data sets and projects into common sensitivity tiers, with recommended security measures for each tier and a web-based tool to support this process.
- A proposal for how to design productive and secure research environments
- A productive environment for curiosity-driven research, that includes many data science software packages out-of-the-box.

If this sounds interesting to you, take a look at our GitHub releases: [![Data Safe Haven releases](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Data%20Safe%20Haven&message=Releases&style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/releases).
