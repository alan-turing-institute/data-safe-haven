# Safe Haven Documentation

We organise our documentation into four types. Read in accordance to what might be most helpful to you.

## Tutorials and overview

**Recommended if**: you have no prior experience using our Safe Havens and want to be guided through the basics. Instructions about how to deploy your own Safe Haven are here.

See [Tutorials and overview](tutorial/README.md) for more information

## How-to guides

**Recommended if**: You want to use a Safe Haven that you, or someone else, has already deployed (following the instructions in the tutorial).

See [How-to guides](how_to_guides/README.md) for more information

## Explanations and design decisions

**Recommended if**: You want to develop a deeper understanding of the different aspects of Safe Haven design and the motivations behind them.

See [Explanations](explanations/README.md)

## Reference materials

**Recommended if**: You want a technical understanding of aspects of our Safe Haven implementation using Azure.
