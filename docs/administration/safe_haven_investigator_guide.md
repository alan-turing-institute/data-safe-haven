## :beginner: Introduction: The Turing Safe Haven
Before you get started in using a safe haven, you'll need to have classified the data you're using to understand its sensitivity, and how it should be handled. The classification should be done for each work package (the combination of all linked data you'll be handling over the project) at ingress and egress from your safe haven environment. There are 5 tiers, ranging from open data at Tier 0, to highly sensitive and high risk data at Tier 4. You can find out more about classifying project data, and how to do it, in our policy paper, available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08737
