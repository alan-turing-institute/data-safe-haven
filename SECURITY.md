## Reporting a Vulnerability

This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to any vulnerabilities you are considering
reporting related to the Data Safe Haven. We recommend reading this vulnerability
disclosure policy fully before you report a vulnerability and always acting in
compliance with it.

We value those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities
according to this policy. However, we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability
disclosures.

### Reporting
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit your report to us
using the following email: safehavendevs@turing.ac.uk

In your report please include details of:
- The area / component of the Data Safe Haven where the vulnerability can be observed.
- A brief description of the type of vulnerability, for example; “unexpected outbound data access” or "privilege escalation to admin user".
- Steps to reproduce. These should be a benign, non-destructive, proof of concept. This
helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and accurately. It also reduces
the likelihood of duplicate reports, or malicious exploitation of some vulnerabilities.

### What to expect
After you have submitted your report, we will respond to your report within 5 working
days and aim to triage your report within 10 working days. We’ll also aim to keep you
informed of our progress.

Priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity and exploit
complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You are
welcome to enquire on the status but should avoid doing so more than once every 14
days. This allows our teams to focus on the remediation.

We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be
invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.

Once your vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your 
report. We’d like to unify guidance to affected users, so please do continue to 
coordinate any public release with us.

### Guidance
You must NOT:
* Break any applicable law or regulations.
* Access unnecessary, excessive or significant amounts of data.
* Modify data in any organisation's systems or services.
* Use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.
* Attempt or report any form of denial of service, e.g. overwhelming a service with a
high volume of requests.
* Disrupt any organisation's services or systems.
