# The Turing Data Safe Haven

Welcome to the Turing's [Data Safe Havens in the Cloud](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/data-safe-havens-cloud) project. This repository contains the code necessary to deploy an instance of the Alan Turing Institute's Data Safe Haven, and instructions on how to use it.

## What is a Data Safe Haven

Many of the important questions we want to answer for society require the use of sensitive data. In order to effectively answer these questions, the right balance must be struck between ensuring the security of the data and enabling effective research using the data.

In consultation with the community, we have been developing recommended policies and controls for performing productive research on sensitive data, as well as a cloud-based reference implementation in order to adress some of the above challenges. 

We have developed:

- A shared model for classifying data sets and projects into common sensitivity tiers, with recommended security measures for each tier and a web-based tool to support this process.
- A cloud-based Safe Haven implementation using software defined infrastructure to support the reliable, efficient and safe deployment of project specific secure research environments tailored to the agreed sensitivity tier for the project.
- A productive environment for curiosity-driven research, including access to a wide range of data science software packages and community provided code.

## Contributing

We worked together with the community to develop the policy, processes and design decisions for our Safe Haven, and we are keen to transition our implementation from being a Turing project to being a community owned platform which we work together with a range of other organisations to maintain and extend.

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in the project. There are lots of ways to contribute, not just writing code. See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and our [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how you can contribute and how we work together as a community.
