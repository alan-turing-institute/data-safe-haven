# :eyes: What is the Turing Data Safe Haven?

The **Turing Data Safe Haven** is an open-source framework for creating secure environments to analyse sensitive data.
It provides a set of scripts and templates that will allow you to deploy, administer and use your own secure environment.
It was developed as part of the Alan Turing Institute's [Data Safe Havens in the Cloud](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/data-safe-havens-cloud) project.

## :open_hands: Contributing

We are keen to transition our implementation from being a [Turing](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) project to being a community owned platform.
We have worked together with the community to develop the policy, processes and design decisions for the Data Safe Haven.

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in the project.
There are lots of ways to contribute, not just writing code!

See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and our [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how we work together as a community and how you can contribute.

## :cake: Releases

If you're new to the project, why not check out our [latest release](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/releases/latest)?

You can also browse [all our releases](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/releases).
Follow the link from any release to view and clone this repository as at that release.

Read our [versioning scheme](VERSIONING.md) for how we number and label releases, as well as details of releases that have been used in production and releases that have undergone formal security evaluation.

When making a new release, open an issue on GitHub and choose the `Release checklist` template, which can be used to track the completion of security checks for the release.

## :mailbox_with_mail: Vulnerability disclosure

We value those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities.
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it as outlined in our [Security and vulnerability disclosure policy](SECURITY.md).
